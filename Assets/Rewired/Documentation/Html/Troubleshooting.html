    <h3><a name="something-isnt-working"></a>Something isn't working...</h3>
    <p>The single most common solution to a wide variety of support questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Do you have warnings enabled in the Unity console?</li>
    </ul>
<p>Ensure warnings are enabled in the Unity console so you can see important messages created by Rewired for a variety of common situations. You should also have normal log messages and errors enabled. This can save a lot of time and back and forth questions.</p>

    <h3><a name="debug-information" id="debug-information"></a>Debug Information: How to find the source of the problem</h3>
    <p><img src="files/images/inputmanager_inspector_debug_info.png" alt="" class="right" />You can easily determine why something is not working by looking at the Player, Joystick, Controller Map, and other objects in the Debug Information foldout in the <a href="InputManager.html#inspector">Rewired Input Manager inspector</a>. This shows a ton of useful information allowing you to visualize most objects in the system at runtime. For example, you can see if a Joystick has been assigned to a Player  or view which Joystick Maps have been assigned and enabled.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br />
      When viewing live information in the inspector such as Joystick button/axis values, you must click back into the Game window first or input values will not be updated. Input values are only updated when the Game window has focus in the Unity editor.</p>
    <p><strong>Prefab Method:<br />
  </strong>For game builds where you do not have access to the inspector, you can use the prefab in Assets/Rewired/DevTools/DebugInformation. Drag this prefab into your scene and build. It will display on screen the same information shown in the Debug Information foldout in the inspector. You can use the mouse or the touch screen to unfold the various items to find the information you want.</p>
<p><strong>Scripting Method:</strong><br />
  You can also get this information by using a little bit of debug code. This code will show all Joysticks assigned to each Player and all mappings in each Controller Map. You will be able to tell if a Joystick is assigned to a particular Player, if any Controller Maps were loaded for that Joystick, whether or not those Controller Maps are enabled, and the what Action is bound to each element.

    <p>      There are 4 things that go into determining value of an Action in Player:</p>

      <li>The Controller Map(s) that binds Controller elements to Actions.</li>

    <h3><a name="gamepad-doesnt-work"></a><a name="controller-doesnt-work"></a>My controller doesn't work</h3>
    <p>If you're using a controller <a href="SupportedControllers.html">that   is not listed here</a>, your controller doesn't have a hardware definition and will not   automatically be recognized and mapped. Instead, it will use the Unknown Controller map and need to be manually mapped by the user prior to use through a custom control remapping screen. Please read about the <a href="ControllerMaps.html#unknown-controllers">Unknown Controller map and how unrecognized controllers are handled</a> to understand why.</p>
    <p><strong>My gamepad doesn't work. I created a map using the Gamepad Template but it doesn't work.</strong></p>
    <p>Just because a controller is a gamepad does not mean Rewired will recognize it as a gamepad. Just what a &quot;gamepad&quot; is varies from product to product. There is no universal definition of a gamepad and the device itself does not provide any kind of element layout information. The Gamepad Template only applies to <a href="SupportedControllers.html">controllers that have had definitions created for them</a> and have been specifically assigned and configured for that template. If you want to use a gamepad <a href="SupportedControllers.html">that is not listed here</a>, you either have to <a href="HowTos.html#new-controller-definitions">make a controller definition for it</a> and <a href="HowTos.html#add-controller-to-existing-controller-template">add it to the Gamepad Template</a> or <a href="HowTos.html#controller-mapping-screen">provide your users with a control remapping screen</a> so they can map the controls themselves.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="controller-doesnt-work-more-reasons" id="controller-doesnt-work-more-reasons"></a>More reasons why your controller may appear not to work:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have multiple controllers connected, one Player, and have left the default <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Joystick Auto-Assignment Settings in the Rewired input manager</a>: 
        Based on the default settings, Rewired will assign only one controller per-Player. If multiple controllers are present, only one will be assigned to each Player. If you only have one Player, the second controller will be left unassigned. In order to allow auto-assignment of multiple Joysticks to the same Player, Max Joysticks Per Player must be raised to a value greater than 1.  <a href="Controllers.html">See this page for information on Controllers</a>.    </li>
    </ul>

<h3><a name="works-in-editor-not-in-build" id="works-in-editor-not-in-build"></a>Something works in the editor but not in a Standalone build</h3>
<p>Differences in the editor and builds are almost always caused by one of two 
  possible issues:<br />
  <br />
  1. Controller Mappings are incorrect. You are saving XML data (using <a href="ControlMapper.html">Control Mapper</a> or   some other system) and 
  your saved data has different mappings. Clear your user  save data to reset the mappings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="UserDataStore.html#clearing-playerprefs">UserDataStore - Clearing PlayerPrefs</a></li>
<li><a href="ControlMapper.html#saving-and-loading#clear-xml-data">Control Mapper - Clear XML data</a></li>
</ul>
  <p>UserDataStore   logs a message in the editor every time XML data is loaded 
  specifically for   the purpose of reminding you of this possibility.<br />
  <br />
  You can <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/Troubleshooting.html#debug-information">view Controller   Maps live</a> in both the editor and in builds to see 
  exactly what configuration   is loaded.<br />
  <br />
  2.   When you create the build, the scene you are building is not the same 
  scene   you are testing in the editor. The Rewired Input Manager prefab in the
  build   scene has different data saved in it compared to the Rewired Input 
  Manager   in the scene you are testing in the editor, so you see differences. 
  Select   the prefab in one of the two scenes (the one with the incorrect data) 
  and   press &quot;Revert&quot; at the top of the inspector to revert it to the prefab 
  parent   settings. If this doesn't work, go to the prefab with the correct 
  data and   press &quot;Apply&quot; at the top of the inspector to commit its data to the 
  prefab   parent.</p>

  <h3><a name="keyboard-ghosting" id="dll-not-found-xinput6"></a><a name="key-jamming" id="key-jamming"></a>Two or more keyboard keys cannot be pressed at the same time</h3>
  <p>If you find that no input value is returned when two or more keyboard keys are pressed at the same time, you are experiencing a hardware limitation of your particular keyboard called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#Key_jamming_and_ghosting" target="_blank">key jamming</a>. This can affect any type of computer that uses a keyboard. This is not an issue with Rewired and there is no possible way to work around this issue in software because no signal is being sent from the keyboard.</p>

<h3><a name="not-initialized" id="not-initialized"></a>Rewired is not initialized error</h3>
<p>If you see the following error at runtime in the log:</p>
<p>&quot;Rewired is not initialized. Do you have a Rewired Input Manager in the scene and enabled?&quot;</p>
<p>There are only 3 reasons you could get this error:</p>
<ol>
  <li>There is no enabled Rewired Input Manager in the scene.</li>
  <li>You canceled the installation process when Rewired tried to install itself and the Script Execution Order was not set causing Rewired to run after your other scripts and therefore it cannot initialize before you try to call it.</li>
  <li>The Script Execution Order that Rewired sets during installation was changed or removed by some other asset that was installed. This can happen with assets that contain an entire project. These assets will warn you before installation that they will overwrite the entire project.</li>
</ol>
<p>The solution to #1 is to add a Rewired Input Manager to the scene.</p>
<p>The solution to #2 and #3 is to re-run the Rewired installation script by going to the menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</li>
</ul>
<p>Proceed with the installation and Rewired will set its Script Execution Order.</p>

<h3><a name="exception-input-manager-entries-not-setup" id="exception-input-manager-entries-not-setup"></a>Exception: &quot;Message: Input Axis MouseAxis1 is not setup.&quot;</h3>
<p>Rewired was not installed properly (canceled during installation) preventing it from installing the Unity Input Manager entries necessary for supporting input on Unity fallback platforms and for getting mouse input when Native Mouse Handling is unavailable or disabled. Another possible cause is that these entries were deleted by some other asset installed after Rewired. This can happen with assets that contain an entire project. These assets will warn you before installation that they will overwrite the entire project. It can also happen if the asset contains its own Input Manager settings and overwrites the file instead of adding entries to it.</p>
<p>The solution is to re-run the Rewired installation script by going to the menu:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</li>

<p>If Rewired works in the editor but not on certain platforms, check the log file. The logs will tell you if Rewired was unable to initialize or any other errors that may have occurred.</p>
<p>The most common reason for this issue is that Rewired was not installed properly (canceled during installation) preventing it from installing the Unity Input Manager entries necessary for supporting input on Unity fallback platforms.

<h3><a name="time-comparison" id="compile-errors-ps4-xbone2"></a>Time comparisons to Time.time don't match</h3>
<p>When doing time comparisons to the current time from methods such as Controller.GetLastTimeActive(), you must compare current time based on ReInput.time.unscaledTime, <strong>not</strong> Time.time or Time.unscaledTime as Rewired always uses its own unscaled time calculation for all input for better accuracy in the various update loops. Do not compare against Time.unscaledTime as this is not always in perfect sync with Rewired's unscaled time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="ongui-getbuttondown" id="ongui-getbuttondown"></a>OnGUI may return GetButtonDown/Up true for multiple frames</h3>
<p>Due to the unpredictable order of OnGUI Repaint updates even with Script Execution Order set, Rewired has no way of being guaranteed to run first OnGUI Repaint events. Therefore, it is impossible to guarantee the input system will be able to update itself in the Repaint event before another script with an OnGUI call updates. Input may not yet be updated in the frame in which you are calling GetButtonDown from an OnGUI Repaint event and you may get the last frame's value (the value generated in the Layout event) for GetButtonDown. The end result is you may receive GetButtonDown or GetButtonUp multiple times in a row -- once in the Layout event and again in the Repaint event. In order to avoid this issue, only check for input in the Layout event as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre class="code">void OnGUI() {
    if(Event.current.type == EventType.Layout) {
        if(player.GetButtonDown("MyAction")) {
            // do something
        }
    }
}</pre>

<h3><a name="digital-axis-smoothing" id="android-joystick-keyboard-keys2"></a>When a keyboard key or D-Pad is pressed, GetAxis value ramps up/down slowly instead instantly returning 1/-1</h3>
<p>You have left the default Input Behavior Digital Axis settings. <a href="InputBehaviors.html">Please read the documentaion on Input Behaviors</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Axis Settings:<br />
  These settings allow buttons and keyboard keys to be treated like axes and return values ranging from -1 to 1 instead of just True and False as is the usual case. This allows you, for instance, to have smooth character movement when using the keyboard for movement controls. The GetAxis value of the Action can be smoothed over time based on the Digital Axis Settings (gravity and sensitivity). See <a href="RewiredEditor.html#InputBehaviors">Rewired Editor - Input Behaviors</a> for more information about each setting.</p>
<p>The default values have been set to mimic Unity's default Gravity and Sensitivity settings.</p>
<p>To get an instant on/off value for a keyboard key, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Disable Digital Axis Simulation in the Action's Input Behavior.</li>
  <li>Use player.GetButton and player.GetNegativeButton instead of GetAxis when getting the value of the Action.</li>
  <li>Use player.GetAxisRaw instead of GetAxis when getting the value of the Action.</li>

The exact same download location is used for all versions of Unity from 5.0 onward, so when you switch to a different major version of Unity, the Unity Asset Store installer will install a copy of Rewired which was downloaded for a different version of Unity. The only solution is to delete the cached download and re-download it in Unity editor. <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetStore.html" target="_blank">See the Unity Manual</a> for location of the Asset Store files.</p>

<h3><a name="installation-problems-and-compiler-errors" id="installation-problems-and-compiler-errors"></a>Rewired does not install or has compiler errors immediately after installation</h3>
<p>A very common error users make is to install a version of Rewired built for a newer major version of Unity in an older version of Unity. This happens because of Unity’s very poor choice to save Asset Store   downloads from the Unity 5, 2017, and 2018 branches of Unity in the exact same folder in   %appdata%\Unity\Asset Store-5x (on Windows). If you download the Unity 2018 version of Rewired from the Asset   Store in Unity 2018, then go back to Unity 2017 and press Install without downloading Rewired again, Unity   will install the 2017 version of Rewired which contains asset files that were   saved in Unity 2018 and are therefore incompatible with 2017. Download Rewired again from the Unity Asset Store in Unity 2017 before installing Rewired and you   won’t have any issues.</p>
<p>You will get the following compiler error if you install Rewired for Unity 2018 in Unity 2017:</p>
<p>Assets/Rewired/Internal/Scripts/Misc/ExternalTools.cs
  (80,18):   error CS0535: `Rewired.Utils.ExternalTools' does not

<h3><a name="compiler-errors-name-clashes" id="compiler-errors-name-clashes"></a>Compiler errors with Rewired classes such as Rewired.Player</h3>
<p>It is sometimes possible to have class names in your project that may clash with Rewired classes such as Rewired.Player. If you have a global Player class declared in your project, the compiler will prefer that globally-declared Player over the Rewired.Player even with the &quot;using Rewired;&quot;
  statement placed at the top of your script. (A globally-declared class is a class declared  outside of any namespace.)</p>
<p>If you receive a compiler error such as the following, you have a globally-declared class, interface, struct, or enum that clashes with a Rewired class name:</p>
<pre class="code">Assets/Scripts/MyScript.cs(16,9): error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type `Rewired.Player' to `Player'</pre>
<p>In general, it is very bad practice to have any classes declared globally. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Unity users, including many who sell assets on the Unity Asset Store, do not use namespaces. Therefore, there is a high probability of class name clashes. If you do not know what namespaces are, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0d941h9d.aspx">read about them on MSDN here</a>.</p>
<p> In these cases, if you have a class that clashes with a Rewired class, it is best to use the fully-qualified name of the Rewired class in your script such as Rewired.Player instead of just Player.</p>
<p>This example shows how to explicitly declare the Rewired.Player class to avoid clashes:</p>
<pre class="code">
using UnityEngine;
using Rewired;

public class MyClass {
    public Rewired.Player rewiredPlayer; <span class="comment">// explicit declaration of the fully-qualified class name to avoid clashes with global Player classes.</span>
}</pre>
You can also move the &quot;using Rewired;&quot; statment from the top of your script to inside your namespace declaration (provided you are using a namespace for your class) like this:
<pre class="code">using UnityEngine;

namespace MyNamespace {
    using Rewired; <span class="comment">// this declaration will make Rewired classes take precedence over any global classes of the same name</span>

    public class MyClass {
        public Player rewiredPlayer; <span class="comment">// no more clash because Rewired.Player is higher priority than ::Player (global)</span>
    }
}</pre>
You can also make a single class take precedence over any global class with the same name like this:
<pre class="code">using UnityEngine;
using Rewired;
using Player = Rewired.Player;  <span class="comment">// this declaration will make Rewired.Player take precedence over a global Player class</span>

public class MyClass {
    public Player rewiredPlayer; <span class="comment">// no more clash because Rewired.Player is higher priority than ::Player (global)</span>
}</pre>

<h3><a name="null-reference-during-recompile" id="null-reference-during-recompile"></a>Null reference exception when recompiling scripts in the editor at runtime</h3>
<p>NOTE: This information only applies to runtime recompiling in the editor while in Play mode. If you don't need this functionality, you do not need to do any of the following.</p>
<p>Null reference exceptions thrown during a recompile are a result of a script not checking if Rewired is ready before attempting to access properties or methods of the ReInput class.</p>
<p>If your workflow requires that you edit scripts during runtime, you should be aware that once recompile is triggered, the main Rewired managing class is   destroyed and recreated. All Player, Controller, and other references   are no longer valid. Due to the sheer complexity of Rewired (native   input for example), runtime data is not serialized and therefore   seamless resuming from a runtime recompile is not supported (see below   for details). To prevent your scripts from throwing null reference   exceptions when you recompile during runtime, you should be checking   ReInput.isReady to determine if the system is initialized at the   beginning of your input update.</p>
<p>Code patterns that survive runtime recompiles:</p>
<p><strong>Pattern 1: Get Rewired Player every update</strong></p>
<pre class="code">using UnityEngine;
    using Rewired;
     
    public class RecompileTest : MonoBehaviour {
     
        void Update () {
            if(!ReInput.isReady) return; <span class="comment">// check if Rewired is ready (if false, editor is compiling)</span>

            <span class="comment">// Do input processing</span>
            Player p = ReInput.players.GetPlayer(0); <span class="comment">// get the Player object every update</span>
            Debug.Log(p.GetButton(&quot;Fire&quot;));
        }
    }
</pre>
<ol>
  <li>By checking ReInput.isReady at the beginning of the update and   exiting if it's not ready, you avoid null references while Unity is   recompiling.</li>
  <li>Never make any calls to any Rewired classes while the editor is recompiling (ReInput.isReady == false).</li>
  <li>By getting the Player every update and not storing it, you don't have to worry about it going out of scope after a recompile.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pattern 2: Caching Rewired Player</strong></p>
<p>This pattern allows you to cache your Player object on Awake and not have to get the Player each update. However, when recompiling, you must get a new reference to the Player object after compiling is finished because the original object is no longer valid.</p>
<pre class="code">public int playerId = 0;
private Rewired.Player player;
private bool isRecompiling;
 
void Awake() {
  CacheRewiredPlayer();
}
 
void Update() {
    GetInput();
}
 
void GetInput() {
#if UNITY_EDITOR
    if(IsCompiling()) return; <span class="comment">// exit during recompile</span>
#endif
 
  float value = player.GetAxis(&quot;MyAxis&quot;);
}
 
bool IsCompiling() {
    if(!ReInput.isReady) {
        isRecompiling = true;
        return true;
    } else if(isRecompiling) {
        isRecompiling = false; <span class="comment">// just finished recompiling</span>
        CacheRewiredPlayer(); <span class="comment">// get the new Player object after recompile</span>
    }
    return false;
}
 
void CacheRewiredPlayer() {
  <span class="comment">// Store the Player object</span>
  player = ReInput.players.GetPlayer(playerId);
}</pre>
<p>The #if UNITY_EDITOR preprocessor directive was added because there is no need to check for recompiling in a build since this isn't possible.</p>

Are you missing an assembly reference?</p>
</pre>
<p>Both Utils and Platforms are namespaces in Rewired_Core.dll.<br />
  <br />
  Unity added the ability to designate what platforms DLLs compile to in Unity 5 by setting check boxes on the DLL in the inspector for each platform. Rewired_Core.dll comes with all options checked except Windows App Store. Special versions of Unity add checkboxes for that specific platform (PS4 for example). That special platform check box is not and cannot be automatically checked by Rewired because it is built on a standard Unity build that does not contain these special platforms.</p>
<p>To fix this, simply click on Rewired/Internal/Libraries/Runtime/Rewired_Core.dll and check the appropriate platform checkbox in the inspector.</p>

<h3><a name="missing-files" id="android-joystick-keyboard-keys3"></a>Some component of Rewired is missing (RewiredStandloneInputModule, Control Mapper, etc.)</h3>
<p>If a component of Rewired is missing from the installation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check to make sure you have the latest version of Rewired installed. Go to the menu:<br />
    <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Help -&gt; About</strong></li>
  <li>Make sure the version of Unity you are using is compatible with that component. For example, to use the RewiredStandaloneInputModule or Control Mapper, you must be using Unity 4.6+.</li>
  <li>If neither 1 or 2 apply, then the file may have been deleted or not allowed to install. Make sure Rewired is in the root project Assets/ folder first, then re-run the installer script from the menu:</li>
  <li><strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</strong><br />
    And allow the installer to install. This will not destroy any of your input configuration data which is stored in the Rewired Input Manager game object, not in the Rewired project folder. </li>
  <li>If the files are still missing, delete and reinstall Rewired from the Unity Asset Store. First, delete the entire Rewired folder from the project. This will not destroy any of your input configuration data which is stored in the Rewired Input Manager game object, not in the Rewired project folder.  Then re-install Rewired from the Unity Asset Store.<br />
    <strong>Important:</strong> After deleting the Rewired folder DO NOT save your scene or project until after you have re-installed Rewired. If you save your scene or project while Rewired is deleted, serialzed data on gameobjects in your scene may be erased by Unity because the Rewired classes no longer exist. Once Rewired is re-installed, it should be safe to save your scene, but                                  it would be safer to quit and restart Unity before doing so. </li>

The XBox 360 controller driver only returns a single byte of data for both the left and right triggers making it impossible to distinguish the two when both are pressed simultaneously when using Raw Input or Direct Input.

<h3><a name="windows-xinput-multiple-devices" id="windows-xinput-multiple-devices"></a>Windows, XInput: XInput-compatible device shows up as multiple controllers</h3>
<p>If Use XInput is enabled and you are seeing multiple XInput devices in Rewired when only one controller is plugged in:</p>
<p><strong>If you are seeing multiple devices named &quot;XInput Gamepad 1&quot;, &quot;XInput Gamepad 2&quot;, etc:</strong><br />
  Multiple XInput devices showing up can only be caused at the Windows driver 
  level. Rewired queries XInput.dll directly to get the list of connected 
  XInput devices 0-3. There is no intermediary step involved. Therefore, your <br />
  XInput device is showing up as 2 devices in XInput itself, not Rewired. This is almost always caused by a driver creating multiple devices. Check Windows Device manager for multiple XInput devices under HID and Xbox Peripherals and elsewhere. Uninstall one or all of these drivers, reboot, and try agiain. Another possible cause is if you have a 3rd party tool that 
  creates emulated XInput devices such as DS4Win, PS3 SCP driver, or 
  other tools that emulate XInput devices. Uninstall these tools/drivers and try again.</p>
<p><strong>If you are seeing multiple devices, one named &quot;XInput Gamepad 1&quot; and one named something else like &quot;Controller (XBOX One For Windows)&quot;:</strong><br />
  This error can only happen if the XInput-compatible device does not conform to Microsoft's documented standards for how XInput devices identify themselves. If the device deviates from these standards, Rewired will be unable to filter out XInput devices when it populates its Raw Input or Direct Input device list. This causes it to create both a Raw Input / Direct Input device and an XInput device. The only way to fix these problem devices is to add special case code to manually filter them out individually. <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired#support" target="_blank">Report this device via the support form on the website</a> and include all relevant controller information shown by the Rewired/DevTools/JoystickElementIdentifier tool.

  Fallback handler could not load library C:/.../Mono/libxinput1_4.dll</p>
<p>Those log messages are completely harmless. Mono makes these log entries the first time you make an extern call to a DLL when it tries to find that DLL. It tries all   permutations of a DLL’s name before giving up and throwing an exception if the DLL was not found. This is   the only way to detect the presence of a DLL in C#.</p>
<p>Rewired works with all versions of XInput. Rewired will try to detect and use the best possible version of XInput installed on the user's system starting with XInput 1.4 and going backwards to the original release of XInput until it finds one it can use. The more versions it tries before it finds a suitable version, the more entries will be logged.</p>
<p>These log messages do not indicate any kind of problem with XInput. These log messages are logged by Mono, not Rewired, and cannot be silenced.</p>

<h3><a name="android-joystick-keyboard-keys" id="android-joystick-keyboard-keys"></a>Joystick buttons  activate keyboard keys on Android</h3>
<p>Rewired uses Unity input as the input source in Android so it is subject to its limitations. Most Android joysticks return keyboard keycode values for certain buttons on the controller such as Left Shoulder (Left Shift), Right Shoulder (Right Shift), Back (ESC), Menu (Menu), etc. These keyboard values can be in additon to or instead of a joystick button value. This can be problematic if you've developed your game for both desktop PCs and Android and have keyboard maps already set up for the desktop and you want to use the same input scheme for an Android build. When you press one of these buttons, if it also has an Action assigned through a keyboard map, you may get 2 values returned -- one for the keyboard map and one for the joystick map.</p>
<p>An easy way to prevent this is to set <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Controller_enabled.htm">ReInput.controllers.Keyboard.enabled</a> = false to disable all keyboard input on Android. Special provision has been made for certain Android keycodes used by most joysticks such as Back and Menu so that these will still work when activated by a joystick. In addition to solving this issue, disabling keyboard input improves performance slightly. Note that on Android, even when disabling keyboard support certain keys will still function in order to still be able to support certain buttons on joysticks that return keyboard keycodes such as the Back button.</p>
<p>You can disable keyboard support per-platform on the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor - Settings page</a> or through scripting as shown below.</p>

<p>Apple will be adding support to iOS 13  for Xbox and Playstation 4 controllers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>These controllers DO work already with no changes in Rewired.</li>
  <li>The controllers are treated as every other MFI controller because Apple has chosen to expose them as MFI controllers.</li>
  <li>Rewired has no explicit support for these controllers on iOS. It inherited support through the fact they chose to treat them as MFI controllers. There currently has been no update to Rewired to support these <br />
    controllers in any other way than as generic MFI controllers.</li>
  <li><strong>Extra buttons added in iOS 13 (stick buttons, options, menu) do not currently work because they are not currently supported by Unity.</strong></li>
  <li>Controller.name can be used to identify which MFI controller this is so you can display device specific glyphs. Rewired cannot use the iOS 13 ProductCategory function.  <a href="TestedPlatforms.html">Rewired on iOS uses UnityEngine.Input for all input as shown here, so Apple API calls don't apply.</a></li>
  <li>You must make your Controller Map for the Gamepad Template or the iOS MFI Controller profiles. Controller Maps created for Xbox One Controller, Xbox 360 Controller, or DualShock 4 will not be used on iOS because, to Rewired, these controllers are all simply MFI controllers.</li>
  <li>IF I decide to change the current system implement these new controllers as separate controller definitions for the sole purpose of reporting button element names based on the specific device, that will be done in a future version and listed on the supported controllers page. There are also some very significant disadvantages to doing this including making user mappings no longer universal across MFI devices (when a user changes a mapping for a SteelSeries Nimbus MFI controller, then swaps out with a DS4 or Xbox One controller, it will not inherit those mappings made for the other MFI controller because they would now use different device profiles).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To determine device type to display device-specific glyphs:</strong></p>
<p>Controller.name will return the following for these devices:<br />
  Xbox One:  &quot;Xbox Wireless Controller&quot;<br />
  DualShock 4: 
  &quot;DUALSHOCK 4 Wireless Controller&quot;</p>
<p>Use that to display different graphics for the elements on the MFI controller.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br />
  This behavior may change in a future version of Rewired to load different controller definitions for Xbox and PlayStation controllers requiring you to change the way glyphs are implemented.</p>

<p>In Unity versions 5.3.0+, game controllers no longer work in Unity because the XCode project Unity builds does not automatically reference the required GameController framework.</p>
<p>Solution: Manually add a reference to the GameController or GameKit framework in XCode.</p>

<h3><a name="tvos-joystick-keyboard-keys" id="tvos-joystick-keyboard-keys"></a>Joystick buttons  activate keyboard keys on tvOS</h3>
<p>Rewired uses Unity input as the input source in tvOS so it is subject to its limitations. tvOS joysticks return keyboard keycode values for certain buttons on the controller such as Left Shoulder, Right Shoulder,  etc. These keyboard values are in additon to  a joystick button value. This can be problematic if you've developed your game for both desktop PCs and tvOS and have keyboard maps already set up for the desktop and you want to use the same input scheme for a tvOS build. When you press one of these buttons, if it also has an Action assigned through a keyboard map, you may get 2 values returned -- one for the keyboard map and one for the joystick map.</p>
<p>An easy way to prevent this is to set <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Controller_enabled.htm">ReInput.controllers.Keyboard.enabled</a> = false to disable all keyboard input on tvOS. In addition to solving this issue, disabling keyboard input improves performance slightly.</p>
<p>You can disable keyboard support per-platform on the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor - Settings page</a> or through scripting as shown below.</p>
<pre class="code">void Awake() {
#if UNITY_TVOS &amp;&amp; !UNITY_EDITOR
    Rewired.ReInput.controllers.Keyboard.enabled = false; <span class="comment">// Disable keyboard input on tvOS platform</span>

<h3><a name="tvos-playermouse-pointer-siri-remote" id="tvos-playermouse-pointer-siri-remote"></a>PlayerMouse software pointer does not work with Apple TV Siri Remote</h3>
<p>The Rewired Standalone Input Module works in the same was as the original Unity Standalone Input Module. Touch input takes precedence over mouse input, so if any touch input is detected, mouse input will not be processed.</p>
<p>The Apple TV Siri Remote generates touch input when you touch or swipe anywhere on the touchpad. If you have set up a <a href="PlayerControllers.html#player-mouse">PlayerMouse </a>to allow you to move a software pointer with the Siri Remote's touchpad, you must disable touch support on the Rewired Standalone Input Module, otherwise the touch events will be processed and the PlayerMouse will not move when you interact with the remote's touchpad.</p>
<p>The Rewired Standalone Input Module's &quot;Touch Supported&quot; option must be disabled on TV OS for PlayerMouse to work properly with the Apple TV Siri Remote. </p>

<h3><a name="xbox-one-controller-events-dont-work" id="xbox-one-controller-events-dont-work"></a>XBox One: Controller connect/disconnect events do not work</h3>
<p>I receive reports every month or two about controller connection and disconnection events not working on the Xbox One platform. These events are driven directly by Unity's UnityEngine.XboxOneInput.OnGamepadStateChange   event exposed by Unity which 
  is nothing more than a wrapper for the SDK's   event. For Rewired's events to not be fired means that Unity's events are not being fired (and perhaps the SDK's events below that.)</p>
<p>Every case of this issue has turned out to be something unrelated to the direct issue. For example, if an XInput-compatible controller is attached to the development PC, controller events may not fire on the console. Disconnect the controller from the PC and restart the console and events should start working again.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are not running a packaged build (push deploy, etc.), the events may not fire.</p>
<p>This is not a bug in Rewired causing this issue and there is no solution that can be implemented to fix it.<br />

<h2><a name="steam" id="steam"></a>Steam</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of this information is documentation on how Steam functions and has very little to do with Rewired. Rewired is treated as any other application by Steam and Rewired does not interface with its API in any way. Steam is responsible for making the Steam Controller appear to the application based on the settings you choose in Steam. This information has been included because so many people have problems with setting up things properly in Steam. All of this information has been figured out through trial and error. Frequent changes to Steam are likely to render some or all of this information invalid.</p>
<p>It is impractical for me to provide complete documentation on Steam or how to configure Steam. Steam is a separate system that I did not create and do not have control over. Complete Steam documentation is available in the Steamworks back end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="steamworks" id="compile-errors-ps4-xbone3"></a>Exceptions with Steamworks.Net plugin</h3>
<p>There have been several reports of exceptions being thrown during Rewired's initialization on Windows with the <a href="http://steamworks.github.io/">Steamworks.Net Unity plugin</a>. Thus far, the only information I have is that Steamworks may be setting up a hook that intercepts all external calls and routes them through its callback dispatcher system. When Rewired tries to initialize Raw Input, Steamworks intercepts the call and throws an exception. This is an issue with Steamworks/Steam and not Rewired. Based on reports, it appears to only happen when Steamworks is initialized and certain methods are called before instantiating and initializing Rewired. (I have been unable to reproduce this issue myself thus far.)</p>
<p>There have also been reports of this issue happening when Steam is launched in Big Picture Mode and not in the normal mode.</p>
<p>Until I receive a reliable repro case where I can determine exactly what Steamworks is doing and find a workaround if one exists, the only solution is to always initialize Rewired first before Steamworks. This means you must have your Rewired Input Manager in your scene before your Steamworks manager is spawned and initialized and never destroy that Rewired Input Manager for the duration of runtime. (Don't Destroy on Load is checked by default on the Rewired Input Manager.)</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, make sure you avoid ever destroying or shutting down the Rewired system so it never has to do any setup after Steam has already been intialized. This also means you should never change input sources through ReInput.configuration in-game after Steam has been initialized because changing it causes Rewired to Reset. Also never call ReInput.Reset() which will also cause Rewired to do all its setup again.</p>
<p>There are many, many currently games on Steam that use Rewired with no issues whatsoever.</p>

<h3><a name="steam-controller-appears-as-mouse-keyboard" id="steam-controller-appears-as-mouse-keyboard"></a>Steam Controller is appearing as a mouse or keyboard instead of a joystick</h3>
<p>Rewired has no awareness of Steam or the Steam Controller. It is treated by
  Steam as any other application and therefore uses the Steam Controller 
  configuration profiles and rules you've set up in Steam for the application.</p>
<p>Steam can send any application data from the controller as if it's a mouse + 
  keyboard or an XInput gamepad (on Windows for the sake of this example). The 
  application does not have to have any awareness of the Steam Controller and 
  will see mouse input and key strokes and/or XInput gamepad information 
  depending on the settings you've set up in your game profile. Set your game 
  profile up to use the default Gamepad configuration and it will be seen as 
  an XInput controller by default. The user is free to change their Steam Controller configuration and make the controller function as a gamepad, mouse, keyboard, or combination of controller types.</p>
<p>Steam Controller profiles are set up in the Steamworks backend. Configuration of Steamworks is beyond the scope of the Rewired documentation. See the Steamworks documentation for  information on how to set up the Steam Controller for your game.</p>

<h3><a name="steam-windows-steam-controller-unity-editor" id="steam-windows-steam-controller-unity-editor"></a>Steam (Windows): Using the Steam Controller and Steam-configured devices in the Unity Editor</h3>
<p>In terms of controller support, Steam treats the Unity Editor as a Desktop application, not a game. Steam has separate settings for Desktop applications and games in Steam's configuration options.</p>
<p>The settings for Steam-configured controllers (Steam Controller and any controller that is being configured by Steam based on the settings in Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Controller -&gt; General Controller Settings) for Desktop applications can be found at:</p>
<p><strong>Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Controller -&gt; Desktop Configuration</strong></p>
<p>By default, Desktop Configuration support is disabled, so no input will be possible through the Steam Controller or through XInput devices that are created by and controlled by Steam. (This includes Xbox controllers, PS4 controllers, etc. if they are configured for &quot;Configuration Support&quot; in Steam.)</p>
<p>It seems to be impossible to configure a Desktop application to use gamepad controls in the Steam interface. So in order to use non-keyboard/mouse based controls for these devices in the Unity Editor, you must make Steam treat the Unity Editor as a game and not a Desktop application. There are two different ways you can do this, each with it's own issues. You only need to do ONE of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Launch Unity Editor from Steam: </strong>Add your Unity.exe editor executable to Steam from Games -&gt; Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library and launch the Unity Editor from within the Steam interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Launch Steam from Command Line / Shortcut: </strong>Launch Steam using the following undocumented command line (you can also make a shortcut), changing YOUR_APP_ID to the Steam App Id of your game:<br />
    <em>steam.exe -forcecontrollerappid YOUR_APP_ID</em></li>
  </ol>
<p>Noted differences in behavior:</p>
<p>Method 1 - Launch Unity Editor from Steam:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Both XInput 1.3 and XInput 1.4 respect custom bindings for controllers configured by Steam.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Method 2 - Launch Steam from Command Line / Shortcut:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only XInput 1.4 respects custom bindings for controllers configured by Steam if Xinput 1.4 is present. XInput 1.3 still reports unmodified bindings. XInput 1.3 will also not detect a device such as the DS4 which is not a true XInput device, but is made to appear as one by Steam when configured. It is unknown why XInput 1.3 functions in a build along with 1.4 but not in the editor.</li>

<p>This can happen if the user has enabled PS4 Configuration Support  or Generic Gamepad Configuration Support in Steam Big Picture mode under Settings -&gt; Controller or in the main Steam interface in the menu Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Controller -&gt; General Controller Settings. Disable PS4, Xbox, and Generic Gamepad Configuration Support to prevent Steam from modifying controller layouts or creating emulated XInput devices for these devices.</p>
<p><img src="files/images/troubleshooting_steam-big-picture-controller-config.png" alt="Steam Big Picture controller configuration support" /></p>
<p>These settings conflict with the Rewired setting &quot;Use Steam Raw Input Fix&quot; which existed in Rewired versions below 1.0.0.112. The fix was removed because it no longer works due to changes to Steam. If you are experiencing this issue, update to the latest version of Rewired or disable  the option in the Rewired Input Manager under Settings -&gt; Windows -&gt; &quot;Use Steam Raw Input Fix.&quot;</p>
<p>Even without the old Raw Input fix enabled, some devices may not work at all when Generic Gamepad Configuration Support is enabled in Steam. This option causes Steam to try to create an emulated XInput device for the attached controller. Note that this setting applies to <strong>ALL</strong> controllers including flight sticks, etc.,  attached to the system, not just gamepads. This setting frequently makes controllers simply non-functional because Steam is unable to create a working emulated XInput device for it but it still blocks Raw/Direct Input from seeing the device. The result is Rewired sees a dead XInput device and the user gets no input.</p>
<p>Note that on Windows, Steam creates an emulated XInput device for all controllers for which Steam configuration support is enabled. Steam will then block access to and hide the Raw Input device when this option is enabled. Because of how Steam works, this means that <strong>your game must enable Use XInput</strong> or else your users will not be able to use these controllers when configured by Steam.</p>
<p>The above setting is up to the end-user to set properly in their own Steam configuration. The Steam developer back-end also has a setting entitled <strong>Steam Configurator for Third-Party Controllers</strong> which is a duplicate of the above settings, but overrides the end-user's settings for each option if enabled. Note that while this option overrides the end-user's settings if the setting is enabled forcing the option to be enabled even if the end-user disables it, it cannot override in the negative meaning if the end-user has the option enabled in their control panel, the developer setting cannot disable it.</p>
<p>Flight joysticks, racing wheels, and other devices will cease to function entirely if Generic Gamepad Configuration Support is enabled. Other devices may only partially work having certain elements like D-Pads that do not function. Allowing Steam to configure these controllers allows the user to remap their controls within Steam's interface. Allowing the user to remap their controls within Steam while also providing an in-game remapping system will lead to incorrect element identification in-game as the user may have rebound the A button to the Y button for example and there is no way for Rewired to know this. For any of the following reasons, it is recommended you disable support for Steam configuration of controllers in the Steam back-end and inform your users to disable this option in the Steam Big Picture controller configuration settings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your game needs to support more than just gamepads.</li>
  <li>If your game needs to support more than 4 players at once. (XInput is limited to 4 controllers and if Steam is allowed to force gamepads to be XInput devices, there will be a hard limit of 4 controllers.)</li>
  <li>If you provide a means of remapping controls in-game so there aren't two competing remapping systems.</li>
  <li>If you want to support <a href="SupportedControllers.html">all the recognized gamepads or other devices Rewired supports</a>. When Steam takes over and turns devices into XInput devices, Rewired cannot see these devices anymore as HID devices and instead just sees XInput devices. In current testing, there are a number of devices that Steam either does not support (meaning a dead XInput device) or supports improperly (has certain broken elements).</li>
  </ul>
<p>Note that even with Steam controller configuration disabled, Steam Streaming and Steam Link will still work properly provided you have enabled support for XInput.</p>

<h3><a name="steam-osx-linux-duplicate-controllers" id="steam-osx-linux-duplicate-controllers"></a>Steam (OSX/Linux): Some controllers appear as two controllers</h3>
<p>Prior to Rewired 1.1.8.0, some controllers  may appear as two controllers on OSX and Linux when using Steam.  This is due to the fact that Steam creates an additional device for each controller that it recognizes and is allowed to configure. This includes Xbox controllers, Sony DualShock 4, and potentially all gamepads depending on the user's settings in Steam for controller configuration and the game's default Steam developer back-end settings for the Steam Configurator for 3rd party controllers. If a controller is allowed to be configured by Steam, it will create a new device emulating an Xbox controller. Steam does not hide or disable the original controller so Rewired sees both controllers and both will provide input. It is possible to prevent Steam from creating the emulated Xbox controller by disabling Xbox, PS4, and Generic Gamepad Configuration Support in the Steam developer back-end. However, if the user has enabled Steam controller configuration in their local settings, the developer back-end default settings cannot disable it.</p>
<p>Note that even with Steam controller configuration disabled, Steam Streaming and Steam Link will still work properly <a href="#steam-streaming">provided you are using the correct input source for the platform in question</a>.</p>
<p>These duplicate devices are automatically filtered out in Rewired 1.1.8.0+. Specifically, the HID device is filtered out and the emulated Steam Controller device is used instead.</p>

<h3><a name="steam-non-gamepad-devices-dont-work" id="steam-non-gamepad-devices-dont-work"></a>Steam: Flight sticks, racing wheels, and non-gamepad devices do not work</h3>
<p>This can happen if the user has enabled Generic Gamepad Configuration Support in Steam Big Picture mode under Settings -&gt; Controller or in the main Steam interface in the menu Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Controller -&gt; General Controller Settings.</p>
<p><img src="files/images/troubleshooting_steam-big-picture-controller-config.png" alt="Steam Big Picture controller configuration support" /></p>
<p>When Generic Gamepad Configuration Support is enabled, all devices regardless of type will be handled by Steam and converted to emulated Steam Controller devices. If Steam has support for a particular device, it will work as an emulated Steam Controller. However, if Steam does not support the device, the device will simply not appear to the game. Flight sticks, racing wheels, and other device types, and even many gamepads do not work at all when Generic Gamepad Configuration Support is enabled.</p>
<p>Disable Generic Gamepad Configuration Support to prevent Steam from modifying controller layouts or creating emulated Steam Controllers for these devices.</p>
<p>This is an issue with Steam and cannot be controlled, modified, or corrected by Rewired.</p>

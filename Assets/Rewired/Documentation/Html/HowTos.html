    <h3><a name="get-input" id="get-player2"></a>Getting input</h3>
    <p>There are four ways to get input in Rewired:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#get-input-polling-player">Polling the Player for input</a> - This is the most common method and is very similar to how you normally get input in Unity. This method uses the Player-Action system and has all the advantages that provides.</li>
      <li><a href="#get-input-player-events">Using Player input events</a> - This method allows you to get input by registering for an event and receving a callback when that event takes place. This method uses the Player-Action system and has all the advantages that provides.</li>
      <li><a href="#get-input-controller-polling">Polling Controllers</a> - This method ignores the Player-Action system and reads input directly from Controller Elements. This method is difficult to use and not recommended because you have to read input from axes and buttons by index.</li>
      <li><a href="#get-input-controller-template-polling">Polling Controller Templates</a> - This method ignores the Player-Action system and reads input directly from Controller Template Elements. If you don't want to use the Player-Action system and you prefer programming to the Controller directly, it is recommended you use this method.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="get-input-player-polling" id="get-input-player-polling"></a>Method 1: Player Polling</strong></p>
<p>Get input through the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_Player.htm">Player</a> class.</p>
<p>Rewired mirrors Unity's method nomenclature for getting input values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButton.htm">Player.GetButton</a> - Gets the button held state of an <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>. This will return TRUE as long as the button is held.            This also applies to axes being used as buttons. </li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonDown.htm">Player.GetButtonDown</a> - Gets the button just pressed state of an <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>. This will only return TRUE only on the first frame the button is pressed or for the duration of the Button Down Buffer time limit if set in the <a href="InputBehaviors.html">Input Behavior</a> assigned to this <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>.            This also applies to axes being used as buttons. </li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonUp.htm">Player.GetButtonUp</a> - Get the button just released state for an <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>. This will only return TRUE for the first frame the button is released.            This also applies to axes being used as buttons.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetAxis.htm">Player.GetAxis</a> - Gets the axis value of an <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_Player.htm">There are many more methods available in the Player class.</a></li>
  </ul>
<p>All Actions can be queried for Button or Axis value regardless of the underlying hardware mapped to that <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>.</p>
<pre class="code">

<p>Use delegates to receive input events from a <a href="Players.html">Player</a>. There are <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_AddInputEventDelegate.htm">numerous overloads</a> available that allow you to register to receive events on different update loops, for specific input event types, and for specific <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a>. For a list of event types and whether they require additional arguments, see <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_InputActionEventType.htm">InputActionEventType</a>.</p>

    <p>Note: <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a> are not guaranteed to be available on Awake or Start on all platforms or input sources.

    <h3><a name="enabling-disabling-controller-maps" id="enabling-disabling-controller-maps"></a>Enabling and disabling Controller Maps</h3>
    <p><a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> can be enabled or disabled at will via scripting. This can be useful if you want to change game modes and have a different set of controls become active. For example, opening a menu screen. Disabled <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> will not return any value when the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> is queried for an <a href="Actions.html">Action's</a> input value. <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> are stored in the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/?topic=html/T_Rewired_Player.htm">Player</a> class.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to enable and disable maps in a <a href="Players.html">Player</a> is to use the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_MapHelper_SetAllMapsEnabled.htm">player.controllers.maps.SetAllMapsEnabled</a> - Set enabled state on all maps owned by the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> or all maps for a specific <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> type.</li>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_MapHelper_SetMapsEnabled.htm">player.controllers.maps.SetMapsEnabled</a> - Set enabled state on a group of maps owned by the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> by <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> type, <a href="MapCategories.html">Map Category</a>, and <a href="Layouts.html">Layout</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Example: Set enabled state on all of a <a href="Players.html">Player's</a> <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> in a certain <a href="MapCategories.html">Map Category</a> for all <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> types with one line of code.</p>
    <pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// The quick way - one line of code</span>
player.controllers.maps.SetMapsEnabled(state, categoryName);</pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The above SetMapsEnabled and SetAllMapsEnabled methods are not persistent flags in Player that will set a certain category of map enabled/disabled upon loading. They are simply shortcuts for the below methods that iterate the maps currently loaded in the Player and set them enabled/disabled at the time the method is called. When new Controller Maps are loaded in the Player, either manually or when a Joystick is assigned, the newly loaded maps will be enabled/disabled based on the default enabled state settings for these maps on the Player page in the Rewired Input Manager, not based on previous calls to SetMapsEnabled.</p>
<p>You can also enable and disable maps one by one by getting the maps one by one:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_MapHelper_GetMap.htm">player.controllers.maps.GetMap</a></li>

    </ul>
    <p>Once you have the map, enable or disable it by setting <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_ControllerMap_enabled.htm">controllerMap.enabled</a> = true or <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_ControllerMap_enabled.htm">controllerMap.enabled</a> = false.

<p>Example: Set enabled state on all of a <a href="Players.html">Player's</a> <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> in a certain <a href="MapCategories.html">Map Category</a> for all <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> types one by one.</p>

    <h3><a name="display-glyph-for-action" id="display-glyph-for-action"></a>Displaying a glyph for a Joystick element mapped to an Action</h3>
    <p>There are two different types of glyphs you can display for a Joystick:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#display-glyph-for-action-controller-specific">Glyphs based on the Controller elements specific to that Controller (recommended).</a></li>
      <li><a href="#display-glyph-for-action-template-specific">Glyphs based on Controller Template elements.</a></li>
      </ol>
    <p>Normally, you would want to show glyphs based on the specific controller elements such as &quot;X&quot; on an Xbox controller, &quot;Cross&quot; on a Dual Shock 4, etc. If that's what you want to show, use <a href="#display-glyph-for-action-controller-specific">method 1</a>.</p>
    <p>If instead you want to show generic glyphs based on a Controller Template such as the Gamepad Template (Action Bottom Row 1, Center 1, etc.), use <a href="#display-glyph-for-action-template-specific">method 2</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="display-glyph-for-action-controller-specific" id="display-glyph-for-action-controller-specific"></a>Method 1 - Displaying glyphs for elements on specific Joysticks:</strong></p>
<p>There are three steps involved in displaying on-screen glyphs for <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> elements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> element glyph graphics.</li>
      <li>Create a lookup table of <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> element glyphs.</li>
      <li>Display the glyph on-screen.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>Step 1:<br />
      Obviously this is up to you to decide how your glyphs will look and in what data format they will be in.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br />
  You will need to create a lookup table that associates particular Element Identifiers from particular <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a> to the glyphs. This could be in any format you choose -- a database lookup, serialized data in a MonoBehaviour, etc.</p>
<p>(To save time, you can <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllerElementIdentifiersCSV.zip">download a CSV file of the current controller element identifiers here</a>.)<br />
  (You can <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllersCSV.zip">download a CSV file of the current Controllers here</a>.)</p>
<p>This would look something like this in concept:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Joystick</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Guid</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Element Identifier</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Glyph</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Xbox 360 Controller</td>
    <td>d74a350e-fe8b-4e9e-bbcd-efff16d34115</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>360_LeftStick_Horiz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>360_LeftStick_Vert</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>360_ButtonA</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important Joysticks to support are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unknown Controller (used for all unrecognized controllers)</li>
  <li>Xbox 360 Controller (used for all XInput-compatible gamepads on Windows when Use XInput is enabled)</li>
  <li>Xbox One Controller</li>
  <li>Sony DualShock 4</li>
  <li>Steam Controller (used for the Steam Controller on OSX and Linux)</li>
  <li>iOS MFi Gamepad (used for all gamepads on iOS and tvOS)</li>
  <li>Standardized Gamepad (used for unrecognized gamepads on Android)</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3:<br />
  Display the glyph on screen. This is up to you however you choose to do so depending on your data format and needs.</p>
<p>You can retrieve the glpyh based on the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick's</a> GUID and the current Element Identifier Id mapped to a particular <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get the last used <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> from the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> using <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetLastActiveController.htm">Player.controllers.GetLastActiveController</a>.</li>
  <li>Determine the type of the <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Controller_type.htm">Controller.type</a> property.</li>
  <li>If a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>, identify this <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> as a recognized type using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Joystick_hardwareTypeGuid.htm">Joystick.hardwareTypeGuid</a> property. (The type GUID for each recognized <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> can be found <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllersCSV.zip">in this CSV file</a>.)</li>
  <li>Check if any element on this <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> is mapped to the <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> in question using one of the following methods:
<ul>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_MapHelper_GetFirstElementMapWithAction.htm">Player.controllers.maps.GetFirstElementMapWithAction</a></li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the element is mapped, use this information to look up the glyph from your lookup table using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ActionElementMap.htm">ActionElementMap.elementIdentifierId</a> property and the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Joystick_hardwareTypeGuid.htm">Joystick.hardwareTypeGuid</a> property.</li>
  <li>Optional: Further information about the mapping can be found in the ActionElementMap such as the Axis Range, Axis Contribution, type, or other useful information should you need more specific glyphs for a finer level of detail.</li>

<p><strong><a name="display-glyph-for-action-template-specific" id="display-glyph-for-action-template-specific"></a>Method 2 - Displaying glyphs for elements on Controller Templates:</strong></p>
<p>Only <a href="SupportedControllers.html">recognized Controllers listed here</a> are compatible with <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Templates</a>. Unknown Controllers cannot use Controller Templates and will not be able to use this system.</p>
<p>There are three steps involved in displaying on-screen glyphs for <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template</a> elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template</a><a href="Controllers.html#joysticks"></a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> element glyph graphics.</li>
  <li>Create a lookup table of <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template</a><a href="Controllers.html#joysticks"></a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> element glyphs.</li>
  <li>Display the glyph on-screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1:<br />
  Obviously this is up to you to decide how your glyphs will look and in what data format they will be in.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br />
  You will need to create a lookup table that associates particular Element Identifiers from particular <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Templates</a><a href="Controllers.html#joysticks"></a> to the glyphs. This could be in any format you choose -- a database lookup, serialized data in a MonoBehaviour, etc.</p>
<p>(To save time, you can <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllerTemplateElementIdentifiersCSV.zip">download a CSV file of the current Controller Template element identifiers here</a>.)<br />
  (You can also <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllerTemplatesCSV.zip">download a CSV file of the current Controller Templates here</a>.)</p>
<p>This would look something like this in concept:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Controller Template</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Guid</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Element Identifier</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Glyph</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gamepad Template</td>
    <td>83b427e4-086f-47f3-bb06-be266abd1ca5</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>LeftStick_Horiz</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>LeftStick_Vert</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>ButtonA</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important Controller Template to support is the Gamepad Template.</p>
<p>Step 3:<br />
  Display the glyph on screen. This is up to you however you choose to do so depending on your data format and needs.</p>
<p>You can retrieve the glpyh based on the <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template's</a> GUID and the current Element Identifier Id mapped to a particular <a href="Actions.html">Action</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get the last used <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> from the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> using <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetLastActiveController.htm">Player.controllers.GetLastActiveController</a>.</li>
  <li>Get the first <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template</a> from the Controller  using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Controller_Templates.htm">Controller.Templates</a> property.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_IControllerTemplate_typeGuid.htm">IControllerTemplate.typeGuid</a> property to look up the glyph. (The type GUID for each <a href="ControllerTemplates.html">Controller Template</a> can be found in <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllerTemplatesCSV.zip">this CSV file</a>.)</li>
  <li>Check if any element on this <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a><a href="ControllerTemplates.html"></a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> is mapped to the <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> in question using one of the following methods:
    <ul>

      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="ControllerTemplates.html#action-map-to-controller-template-element">Convert the  returned Action Element Map into a Controller Template Element Target</a> by passing the Action Element Map to the IControllerTemplate.GetElementTargets method.</li>
  <li>Use this information to look up the glyph from your lookup table using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_IControllerTemplateElement_id.htm">ControllerTemplateElementTarget.element.id</a> property and the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_IControllerTemplate_typeGuid.htm">IControllerTemplate.typeGuid</a> property.</li>
  <li>Optional: Further information about the mapping can be found in the ControllerTemplateElementTarget such as the Axis Range or other useful information should you need more specific glyphs for a finer level of detail.</li>

    <h3><a name="last-used-controller" id="last-used-controller"></a>Determining which Controller was last used</h3>
    <p>You can determine which <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> or what type of Controller was last used system-wide<a href="Players.html"></a> or by an individual <a href="Players.html">Player</a>. One common use of this technique is to switch on-screen glyphs depending on whether the user is using a mouse/keyboard or a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>.</p>
    <p>Use the following methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetLastActiveController.htm">ReInput.controllers.GetLastActiveController</a></li>
      
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetLastActiveControllerType.htm">ReInput.controllers.GetLastActiveControllerType</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_GetLastActiveController.htm">Player.controllers.GetLastActiveController</a></li>
      </ul>
    <p>The ReInput methods will get the last active controller of all controllers regardless of whether or not it is assigned to a Player or any of the elements have been mapped.  This is most useful for one-player games.</p>
    <p>The Player.controllers.GetLastActiveController method will get the last active controller used by that Player. Be aware that only mapped elements determine whether a Controller just became active. For example, if you're testing to see if the mouse is the last active controller, if nothing is mapped to the left mouse button and it is clicked, it will not be considered the last active controller in the Player.</p>
<p>Then you can get the <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> type from <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Controller_type.htm">Controller.type.</a></p>
    <pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// Get last controller from a Player and the determine the type of controller being used</span>
Controller controller = player.controllers.GetLastActiveController();
if(controller != null) {
  switch(controller.type) {
    case ControllerType.Keyboard:
      <span class="comment">// Do something for keyboard</span>
      break;
    case ControllerType.Joystick:
      <span class="comment">// Do something for joystick</span>
      break;
    case ControllerType.Mouse:

      break;
    case ControllerType.Custom:
      <span class="comment">// Do something custom controller</span>

<h3><a name="relative-absolute-axes" id="relative-absolute-axes"></a>Handling Mouse and Joystick axes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mouse axes always return relative values (change in value since the last frame) unless the Input Behavior Mouse X/Y Axis Mode or Mouse Other Axis Mode has been set to &quot;Digital Axis&quot;. Relative axes should never be multiplied by Time.deltaTime.</li>
  <li>Joystick and Keyboard axes always return absolute values (an absolute value from -1 to +1). Absolute axes must be multiplied by Time.deltaTime.</li>
  <li>Custom Controller axes can return relative or absolute values depending on how you configured the axis.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Determining which type of axis is being used for an Action</strong></p>
<p>You have your choice of how to handle this. Do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Check the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetAxisCoordinateMode.htm">player.GetAxisCoordinateMode</a> method for the Action to determine if it's a relative or absolute axis.</li>
  <li>Check the <a href="#last-used-controller">last used controller type</a> to determine whether it's a mouse or other device type being used.</li>
  <li>Create separate Actions for Mouse axes and Joystick axes.</li>

    <h3><a name="calibrating-controller-axes" id="calibrating-controller-axes"></a>Calibrating Joystick axes</h3>
    <p>The general process of calibrating <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> axes is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#get-controller">Get the Joystick.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_ControllerWithAxes_calibrationMap.htm">Get the Calibration Map from the Joystick.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_CalibrationMap_GetAxis.htm">Get the AxisCalibration for the Axis from the Calibration Map.</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_AxisCalibration.htm">Set the calibrated values in the AxisCalibration object.</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can see an example of axis calibration in Rewired/Examples/ControlRemapping1.</p>
    <p><strong>Enabled</strong><br />
      The enabled state of the Axis can be set with the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_enabled.htm">AxisCalibration.enabled</a> property. Disabled Axes always return 0.</p>
    <p><strong>Dead zone</strong><br />
      The dead zone of the Axis can be set with the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_deadZone.htm">AxisCalibration.deadZone</a> property. If the Axis's absolute value is less than or equal to the dead zone, it will return 0.</p>
<p><strong>Min, max, zero</strong><br />
The Axis's value can be converted to a new range using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_calibratedMin.htm">AxisCalibration.calibratedMin</a>, <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_calibratedMax.htm">AxisCalibration.calibratedMax</a>, and <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_calibratedZero.htm">AxisCalibration.calibratedZero</a> properties. These can be used to transform the value of an Axis such as a gamepad trigger that returns -1 at a resting state into a more useful range of 0 when at rest, 1 when fully pressed. If <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_applyRangeCalibration.htm">AxisCalibration.applyRangeCalibration</a> is set to false, these transformations will not be applied.</p>
    <p><strong>Invert</strong><br />
      If <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_invert.htm">AxisCalibration.invert</a> is set to true, the final value will be multiplied by -1. This can be used to correct an inverted Axis.<br />
</p>
    <p><strong>Sensitivity</strong><br />
      In order to set axis sensitivity, you must set the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_sensitivityType.htm">AxisCalibration.sensitivityType</a> to determine how it will be calculated. If <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_sensitivityType.htm">AxisCalibration.sensitivityType</a> is set to Multiplier 
      or Power, the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_sensitivity.htm">AxisCalibration.sensitivity</a> property is used to calculate the value. If <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_sensitivityType.htm">AxisCalibration.sensitivityType</a> is set to Curve, the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_AxisCalibration_sensitivityCurve.htm">AxisCalibration.sensitivityCurve</a> property is used to calculate the value.<br />

<h3><a name="Vibration-Rumble" id="Vibration-Rumble"></a>Vibration/Rumble</h3>
<p>Rewired supports vibration on compatible controllers on certain platforms. <a href="FAQ.html#force-feedback">See this for more information</a>.</p>
<p>Important: You must have XInput enabled in the Rewired Input Manager on the Windows Standalone platform for Xbox 360 controller vibration support.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can set vibration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Through the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>.</li>
  <li>Through the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>(s).</li>
  </ol>
<p>Setting vibration through the Player allows you to set vibration on all Joysticks assigned to that Player simultaneously.</p>
<pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// Set vibration in all Joysticks assigned to the Player</span>
int motorIndex = 0; <span class="comment">// the first motor</span>
float motorLevel = 1.0f; <span class="comment">// full motor speed</span>
float duration = 2.0f; <span class="comment">// 2 seconds</span>

player.SetVibration(motorIndex, motorLevel, duration);</pre>
<p>To set vibration in the Joystick(s), just get them from the Player class and set the motor levels on 
  each of them. </p>
<pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// Set vibration by motor type</span>
foreach(Joystick j in player.controllers.Joysticks) {
    if(!j.supportsVibration) continue;
    j.SetVibration(leftMotorValue, rightMotorValue);
}

<span class="comment">// Set vibration by motor index</span>
foreach(Joystick j in player.controllers.Joysticks) {
    if(!j.supportsVibration) continue;
    if(j.vibrationMotorCount &gt; 0) j.SetVibration(0, leftMotorValue);
    if(j.vibrationMotorCount &gt; 1) j.SetVibration(1, rightMotorValue);
}

<span class="comment">// Set vibration for a certain duration</span>
foreach(Joystick j in player.controllers.Joysticks) {
    if(!j.supportsVibration) continue;
    if(j.vibrationMotorCount &gt; 0) j.SetVibration(0, leftMotorValue, 1.0f); <span class="comment">// 1 second duration</span>
}

<span class="comment">// Stop vibration</span>
foreach(Joystick j in player.controllers.Joysticks) {
    j.StopVibration();
}</pre>
<p>This would set vibration on all <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> assigned to the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="button-press-types" id="button-press-types"></a>Handling button presses of various types</h3>
<p>Rewired has a number of  methods for handling button presses in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><strong>Most Common:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButton.htm">Player.GetButton</a>: Gets the button held state of an Action. This will return TRUE as long as the button is held. This also applies to axes being used as buttons.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonDown.htm">Player.GetButtonDown</a>: Gets the button just pressed state of an Action. This will only return TRUE only on the first frame the button is pressed or for the duration of the Button Down Buffer time limit if set in the Input Behavior assigned to this Action. This also applies to axes being used as buttons.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonUp.htm">Player.GetButtonUp</a>: Get the button just released state for an Action. This will only return TRUE for the first frame the button is released. This also applies to axes being used as buttons.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Double Press:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonDoublePressHold.htm">Player.GetButtonDoublePressHold</a>: Gets the button double pressed and held state of an Action. This will return TRUE after a double press and the button is then held.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonDoublePressDown.htm">Player.GetButtonDoublePressDown</a>: Gets the button double pressed state of an Action. This will return TRUE only on the first frame of a double press.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonDoublePressUp.htm">Player.GetButtonDoublePressUp</a>: Gets the button double pressed and just released state of an Action. This will return TRUE only on the first frame after a double press is released.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Single Press:</strong></p>
<p>These methods should only be used if you need to detect both a single press and a double press on the same Action because they only return true after a delay.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonSinglePressHold.htm">Player.GetButtonSinglePressHold</a>: Gets the button single pressed and held state of an Action. This will return TRUE after a button is held and the double press timeout has expired. This will never return TRUE if a double press occurs. This method is delayed because it only returns TRUE after the double press timeout has expired. Only use this method if you need to check for both a single press and a double press on the same Action. Otherwise, use GetButton instead for instantaneous button press detection. The double press speed is set in the Input Behavior assigned to the Action.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonSinglePressDown.htm">Player.GetButtonSinglePressDown</a>: Gets the button just single pressed and held state of an Action. This will return TRUE for only the first frame after a button press and after the double press timeout has expired. This will never return TRUE if a double press occurs. This method is delayed because it only returns TRUE after the double press timeout has expired. Only use this method if you need to check for both a single press and a double press on the same Action. Otherwise, use GetButtonDown instead for instantaneous button press detection. The double press speed is set in the Input Behavior assigned to the Action.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonSinglePressUp.htm">Player.GetButtonSinglePressUp</a>: Gets the button single pressed and just released state of an Action. This will return TRUE for only the first frame after the release of a single press. This will never return TRUE if a double press occurs. This method is delayed because it only returns TRUE after the double press timeout has expired. Only use this method if you need to check for both a single press and a double press on the same Action. Otherwise, use GetButtonUp instead for instantaneous button press detection. The double press speed is set in the Input Behavior assigned to the Action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timed Presses:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonTimedPress.htm">Player.GetButtonTimedPress</a>: Gets the button held state of an Action after being held for a period of time.

This will return TRUE only after the button has been held for the specified time and will continue to return TRUE until the button is released. This also applies to axes being used as buttons. The button short press time is set in the Input Behavior assigned to the Action. For a custom duration, use GetButtonTimedPress instead.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonShortPressDown.htm">Player.GetButtonShortPressDown</a>: 	
    Gets the button state of an Action after being held for a period of time. This will return TRUE only on the frame in which the button had been held for the specified time.

  </ul>
<p><strong>Tap / Press:</strong></p>
<p>To differentiate between a short tap and a longer press, simply use a combination of <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonTimedPressUp.htm">Player.GetButtonTimedPressUp</a> and <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonTimedPressDown.htm">Player.GetButtonTimedPressDown</a>. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
if(player.GetButtonTimedPressUp("Action", 0f, 0.7f)) { <span class="comment">// button was released in 0.7 seconds or less</span>
    <span class="comment">// This is a tap</span>
} else if(player.GetButtonTimedPressDown("Action", 0.7f)) { <span class="comment">// button was pressed for 0.7 seconds</span>
    <span class="comment">// This is a press</span>
}</pre>
<p><strong>Repeating:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonRepeating.htm">Player.GetButtonRepeating</a>: Gets the repeating button state of an Action. This will return TRUE when immediately pressed, then FALSE until the Input Behaviour button repeat delay has elapsed, then TRUE for a 1-frame duration repeating at the interval specified in the Input Behavior assigned to the Action. This also applies to axes being used as buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>History:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonPrev.htm">Player.GetButtonPrev</a>: Gets the button held state of an Action during the previous frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonTimePressed.htm">Player.GetButtonTimePressed</a>: Gets the length of time in seconds that a button has been continuously held down. Returns 0 if the button is not currently pressed.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/Overload_Rewired_Player_GetButtonTimeUnpressed.htm">Player.GetButtonTimeUnpressed</a>: Gets the length of time in seconds that a button has not been pressed. Returns 0 if the button is currently pressed.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Negative Buttons:</strong></p>
<p>Each of the methods above also has a corresponding Negative Button method which is named the same except with NegativeButton in place of Button. These serve to allow you to use axes as buttons and will trigger when the negative side of the axis is activated while the standard Button version will trigger only when the positive side of the axis is activated. However, it is usually easier to just map each pole of the axis to a seperate Action (split axis) so that each Action can just be queried with GetButton.</p>
<p>If you want all GetButton calls to return True when either the positive or negative side of the axis is activated, enable the option <a href="RewiredEditor.html#settings-activate-action-buttons-on-negative-value">&quot;Activate Action Buttons on Negative Values&quot; in the Rewired Editor</a>.</p>

To handle button combos, they should be handled in code based on your individual needs (timings, which needs to be pressed first, what cancels what out, etc). In these cases, it can help to think of it as if you're using <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> as buttons:</p>
<pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// This example shows a simple handling of a 2-button combo where the
// modifier button must be held down and the primary button pressed</span>

bool modifier = player.GetButton(&quot;ModifierAction&quot;); <span class="comment">// get the &quot;held&quot; state of the button</span>
bool primary = player.GetButtonDown(&quot;PrimaryAction&quot;); <span class="comment">// get the &quot;just pressed&quot; state of the button</span>

if(modifier &amp;&amp; primary) { <span class="comment">// modifier was held or just pressed and primary was just pressed</span>
    <span class="comment">// Do something</span>
}</pre>
<p>The constituent <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> can be remapped by the user freely and nothing breaks. You also don't have to worry about the complexities of trying to allow the user to remap actual physical button combos for an <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> and worrying about what else may already mapped to the constituent buttons. In addition, this kind of <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> combo will work across multiple <a href="Controllers.html">Controllers</a> and <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a> types since Rewired's <a href="Players.html">Player</a>-based input system is largely controller agnostic.</p>

<h3><a name="excluding-players-from-joystick-assignment" id="excluding-players-from-joystick-assignment"></a>Excluding certain Players from Joystick auto-assignment</h3>
<p>The <a href="Controllers.html#joystick-auto-assignment">joystick auto-assignment system</a> has a number of options available, including the option to exclude certain Players from auto-assignment. The &quot;Exclude from Joy Auto Assign&quot; checkbox <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Players">on the Player in the Rewired Editor</a> allows you to selectively disable joystick auto-assignment for certain Players. Additionally, this can be set in scripting with the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_excludeFromControllerAutoAssignment.htm">player.controllers.excludeFromControllerAssignment</a> property.</p>
<p>Also, the Settings page of the Rewired Editor has <a href="RewiredEditor.html#settings-joystick-auto-assignment">a number of options which can be set for Joystick auto-assignment</a>. The &quot;Assign to Playing Players Only&quot; option allows to you exclude Players who are not currently playing or have been disabled by setting the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Player_isPlaying.htm">Player.isPlaying</a> property to False.</p>

<h3><a name="converting-scripts" id="converting-scripts"></a>Converting scripts from UnityEngine.Input to Rewired</h3>
<p><strong>Unity Input Override (the easy way):</strong></p>
<p> Rewired includes the <a href="UnityInputOverride.html">Unity Input Override</a> script to make converting most scripts from Unity input to Rewired effortless and automatic, requiring no code changes to work. It even works with most assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store. <a href="UnityInputOverride.html">See Unity Input Override for more information</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Modifying script code to use Rewired instead of Unity input (the harder way):</strong></p>
<p>Converting a script from UnityEngine.Input is a very straightforward process for a single player game. For a quick conversion, simply do  two find and replace operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li> &quot;Input.GetButton&quot; -&gt; &quot;Rewired.ReInput.players.GetPlayer(0).GetButton&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Input.GetAxis&quot; -&gt; &quot;Rewired.ReInput.players.GetPlayer(0).GetAxis&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>This will get the value of each <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> from Player 0 for all GetButton, GetButtonDown, GetButtonUp, GetAxis, and GetAxisRaw calls.</p>
<p>You will also need to create the <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> in the Rewired Input Manager that match the string names expected in the code. And of course you will have to create <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, and/or Custom Controller Maps</a> and assign them to <a href="Players.html">Players</a> as is standard Rewired practice.</p>
<p>If your code has Input.GetKey calls, if you want those to instead use Rewired <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a>, you will want to change these to &quot;Rewired.ReInput.players.GetPlayer(0).GetButton&quot; and replace the Unity KeyCode with the name or id of the <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> you want to use.</p>
<p>You could also cache the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> object on Awake for the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> in question and use that variable in the find/replace operation, but the above example provides a quick method to convert most scripts that use UnityEngine.Input to Rewired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="exporting-constants" id="converting-scripts3"></a>Exporting  constants for use in scripting</h3>
<p>On the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Tools">Rewired Input Manager -&gt; Tools page</a>, the section &quot;Export Constants&quot; allows you to export all <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a>, <a href="MapCategories.html">Map Categories</a>, and <a href="Layouts.html">Layouts</a>, to a CS file containing a list of constants. For example, this allows you to use Rewired <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> in scripts without having to type in strings which are prone to typos, plus it allows you take advantage of auto-complete in your IDE. Using constants is also more efficient because integer comparison is faster than  string comparison.</p>
<p>Note: The exported constants will only be valid for the Rewired Input Manager from which they were exported. If you have multiple different Rewired Input Managers with different input configurations, you will have to export from both and use a different parent class name for each so they don't conflict. Also, if you add or delete any relevant items in the Rewired Input Manager, the constant list must be exported again.</p>
<pre class="code">
<span class="comment">// The Action id constants can be used in place of strings throughout the Rewired API</span>

<h3><a name="actionid-property-drawer" id="converting-scripts2"></a>Displaying a drop-down list of Actions in the inspector of a script</h3>
<p>You can display a list of Rewired <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> in a MonoBehaviour script by using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ActionIdPropertyAttribute.htm">ActionIdPropertyAttribute</a> which will automatically create a Unity property drawer in the inspector.</p>
<p><img src="files/images/howtos_actionidproperty.png" alt="ActionIdProperty" /></p>
<p>There are two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#exporting-constants">Export a list of Action id constants from the Rewired Input Manager</a></li>
  <li>Create a public integer field in your script and add the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ActionIdPropertyAttribute.htm">ActionIdProperty</a> attribute</li>
  </ol>
<p><strong>Using the ActionIdProperty attribute</strong></p>
<p>In your MonoBehaviour script, create an integer field (or array/list) and add the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ActionIdPropertyAttribute.htm">ActionIdProperty</a> attribute above it. You must pass this attribute a class Type that contains a list of public integer constants. Each constant will be displayed in the drop-down list.</p>
<p>Optional: You can also pass <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_ActionIdPropertyAttribute.htm">ActionIdProperty</a> an integer Enum type and it will display each item in the enumeration. The drawback of using Enums is that you will have to cast the enum value to an int each time you want to use it in the Rewired API.</p>
<pre class="code">using UnityEngine;
using Rewired;

public class MyClass : MonoBehaviour {

    <span class="comment">// This attribute denotes this int field as a Rewired Action Id property and will display a drop-down list</span>
    <span class="comment">// The class RewiredActions was exported from the Rewired Input Manager and contains a list of Action id constants</span>

<h3><a name="press-start-to-join" id="press-start-to-join"></a>Implementing a &quot;Press Start to Join&quot; Joystick assignment system</h3>
<p>Normally, Rewired will assign <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> to <a href="Players.html">Players</a> when each controller<a href="Controllers.html"></a> is detected based on settings in the Rewired Input Manager -&gt; Settings page. This will assign a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> to each <a href="Players.html">Player</a> in order as they become available so that the first <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> is assigned to Player 0, the second to Player 1, and so on. But the question has come up many times as to how to be able to let users just pick up any attached controller and press &quot;Start&quot;, then have that player join as the next available <a href="Players.html">Player</a> with that <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> assigned. This kind of assignment method isn't as straightforward to implement.</p>
<p>First you should understand a little bit how <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> work. <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller maps</a> are loaded by the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>, not the <a href="Controllers.html">Controller</a>, therefore there is no <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> named &quot;Start&quot; in the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> from which to generate input unless you assign that <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> to a <a href="Players.html">Player</a> first. Because of this, you cannot simply ask each unassigned <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a><a href="Controllers.html"></a> for the value of &quot;Start&quot; to determine if a player wants to join because it doesn't have access to any <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>There are various ways this assignment scheme can be achieved. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Please read through all examples and decide which is most appropriate for your game before choosing a method.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#press-start-to-join-variable-player">Method 1: Using a variable Rewired.Player as an input source for your own Player object</a></li>
  <li><a href="#press-start-to-join-any-button">Method 2: Easy but does not detect &quot;Start&quot;, only any button press</a></li>
  <li><a href="#press-start-to-join-detect-start-manually">Method 3: Detect "Start" button press manually</a></li>
  <li><a href="#press-start-to-join-poll-button-by-index">Method 4: Poll a specific button by index on a specific controller</a></li>
  <li><a href="#press-start-to-join-controller-template">Method 5: Poll a specific button on a Controller Template</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An <a href="Examples.html#press-start-to-join">example is included with Rewired</a> showing the concept in action.<br />
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make your <a href="Players.html">Players</a> (let's say Player 0 – 3) in the editor.</li>
  <li>Assign them all <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Joystick Maps</a> for the<a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a> you want to support.</li>
  <li>Create a &ldquo;Start&rdquo; action and be sure it is assigned in the <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Joystick Maps</a> you assigned to the <a href="Players.html">Players</a> on some button -- preferably, multiple buttons just to be sure in case a particular <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> has no Start button (or &ldquo;Center 2&rdquo; as defined in the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/ControllerMaps.html#gamepad-template" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gamepad Template</a>.) A safe bet would be to put it on &ldquo;Center 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;Action Bottom Row 1&rdquo; for the Gamepad Template, and Button 0 on <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/ControllerMaps.html#unknown-controllers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unknown Controller</a> (if you're defining an Unknown Controller Map).</li>
  <li>Leave <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> auto-assignment enabled. Rewired will give each <a href="Players.html">Rewired.Player</a> a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> if available.</li>
  <li><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_ReInput_PlayerHelper_Players.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Loop through all Rewired.Players</a> and check for player.GetButtonDown(&ldquo;Start&rdquo;).</li>
  <li>Now in your game code, simply assign whichever <a href="Players.html">Rewired.Player</a> returned TRUE to your game-side player object. Your game-side player object may be Player[0], but the <a href="Players.html">Rewired.Player</a> doesn&rsquo;t have to be. The user could press a button on the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> assigned to Rewired.Player[3], but you can still then use Rewired.Player[3] as the input source for your game-side Player[0].</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
  If you also support Keyboard and Mouse, at that point you might want to go ahead and load the appropriate keyboard map <a href="Layouts.html">Layouts</a> for your Player[0] into Rewired.Player[3]. This works best if keyboard <a href="Layouts.html">Layouts</a> for the various in-game players will be fixed. IE: Player 1 always uses the WASD set, Player 2 always uses JIKM, etc. (There are ways to make this assignment dynamic too but that's not covered here.)</p>

  <p>    A quicker but less accurate method would be to do step 1-3 above then:<strong><br />
      </strong><br />
    Loop through each <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> in the <a href="Players.html#system-player">System Player</a> and <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_Controller_GetLastTimeAnyButtonPressed.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">find out which Joystick was the last to have any button pressed</a> and assign that <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> to the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>.<br />
    <br />
    This isn't perfect since any button could have been pressed on any <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> besides the ones assigned to the &quot;Start&quot; action, but in most cases it would probably work fine.<br />
    <br />
    There are also other functions to get the last active <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>, but they won't help you here because you're only concerned with the &quot;Start&quot; button press and not axes, etc.<br />

    <p><a href="UserDataStore.html">UserDataStore</a> is a class designed to help with saving and loading of <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>, <a href="InputBehaviors.html">Input Behaviors</a>, calibration settings, and more. Please see <a href="UserDataStore.html">User Data Store</a> for more information.</p>
    <p>There are several steps involved in saving and loading <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Saving:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get the save data from each <a href="Players.html">Player</a> in XML or JSON format.</li>
      <li>Save the data to a storage medium.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Loading:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify the <a href="Controllers.html">Controllers</a> you want to load maps for.</li>
      <li>Load the map data in XML or JSON format.</li>
      <li>Set the map data in the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Rewired  includes a basic system for storing the saved data -- <a href="UserDataStore.html">UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs</a> which may not be suitable for everyone. Since every game and platform may have different requirements for data storage, you will probably want to write your own data storage system for your specific needs. You will have to save the data in a format most suitable to your game and platform. Possible options are PlayerPrefs, a database, binary or text files, cloud storage, etc. (<a href="UserDataStore.html">UserDataStore</a> can optionally be extended to support any storage medium.)<br />
    </p>
    <p>The example mapping demo in Rewired/Examples/ControlRemapping1 includes saving and loading of <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>, Axis Calibration Maps, and <a href="InputBehaviors.html">Input Behaviors</a>. See this demo project to learn the process of saving and loading. Note: The demo project uses PlayerPrefs for the data storage medium. This is not ideal, but was done for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility for the example. It should not be difficult to substitute another storage medium suitable to your platform. </p>

    <h3><a name="controller-mapping-screen" id="controller-mapping-screen"></a>Creating a controller mapping screen</h3>
    <p>Rewired now includes <a href="ControlMapper.html">Control Mapper</a>, a customizable UI control mapping system built with Unity UI that should fit the needs of many games. Please see <a href="ControlMapper.html">Control Mapper</a> for more information.</p>
    <p><strong>Creating a mapping screen from scratch</strong></p>
    <p> To get you started, for an exhaustive example, see the example mapping screen in <a href="Examples.html#control-remapping-1">Rewired/Examples/ControlRemapping1</a>. The example uses Unity's legacy GUI system.  For a much simpler but less complete example, see <a href="Examples.html#simple-control-remapping">Rewired/Examples/SimpleControlRemapping</a>.</p>
    <p>Every game's needs are different with regards to user mapping screens. The ControlRemapping1 example was built for a fairly complex game with a number of players and various game modes and supports saving and loading <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>, <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> assignment, element remapping, calibration, conflict checking, and more. You should be able to learn what you need to from the example project to create your own mapping screen.</p>
    <p>Before beginning, it is very important to understand the Controller Map structure and how input is processed in a Player. Please read <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> and also <a href="ControllerMaps.html#how-input-is-processed">Controller Maps - How Input is Processed in Controller Maps</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Just as a brief summary, the basic process for changing an element's mapping goes like this:</p>

        <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/T_Rewired_Player_ControllerHelper_MapHelper.htm">Various functions here</a> can help in finding it. For example:<br />

    <h3><a name="new-controller-definitions" id="new-controller-definitions"></a>Creating new controller definitions</h3>
    <p><em>This is an advanced topic. Creating definitions requires a number of tools to help identify the elements and requires thorough testing on several platforms if you desire cross-platform compatibility. To make this process easier, if you have a controller you want to support, please let me know via the support form on the website. I will do my best to get ahold of the controller and add definitions for it. If I cannot, you can arrange to mail the controller to me and I will add definitions for it and then mail it back to you.</em></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkYVkRnjgjk" target="_blank">A video tutorial is available on YouTube here.</a></p>

    <p>You can create your own controller definitions if you want to support a specific controller without requiring the user manually map their controller elements. However there are several things you need to be aware of if you want to modify the list of supported controllers:</p>

      <li>You should copy the ControllerDataFiles object in Rewired/Internal/Data/Controllers to another location (preferably outside the Internal folder) and modify the copy. <em>NEVER modify the original ControllerDataFiles, otherwise when you upgrade Rewired, your ControllerDataFiles will be overwritten and your changes lost.</em></li>
      <li>You will need to link your Rewired Input Manager to the new ControllerDataFiles object. Click your Rewired Input Manager in the scene hierarchy and drag-and-drop your copy of ControllerDataFiles into the Data Files field in the inspector. This will instruct Rewired to use your modified ControllerDataFiles instead of the default original.</li>
      <li><em>NEVER modify any of the default Hardware Joystick Map or Hardware Joystick Template Map files.</em> If you do, the next time you upgrade Rewired, your changes will be overwritten. Instead, make a copy of any map you wish to modify, move it to another location (preferably outside the Internal folder), also copy the ControllerDataFiles object to another location, then link up the reference to the new Hardware Joystick Map or Hardware Joystick Template map in your ControllerDataFiles object.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Now that you know the rules, here are the steps to creating a new controller:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Copy ControllerDataFiles to a new location.</li>
      <li>Create a new HardwareJoystickMap object from the menu: Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Create -&gt; Assets -&gt; Hardware Joystick Map.</li>
      <li>Move the Hardware Joystick Map to a suitable location.</li>
      <li>Click your copy of ControllerDataFiles, then in the inspector, modify the Hardware Joystick Maps array to increase its size.</li>
      <li>Drag and drop your new Hardware Joystick Map into the new element in the array.</li>
      <li>Now, to edit your new Hardware Joystick Map, click its file and then click &quot;Launch Hardware Joystick Map Editor&quot; in the inspector.</li>
      
      <li>Edit the Hardware Joystick Map. The process is as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Create Element Identifiers for each of the controller's physical elements. An element can be designated as an Axis or a Button.</li>
          <li>Select a platform you wish to map such as Raw/Direct Input.</li>
          <li>On the Matching Criteria tab, fill out the information used to identify the controller. You can get this information by using the tool included for the platform you're editing. See Step 8 below.</li>
          <li>Create axes and buttons and map them to the platform's input sources. There are various options to help you deal with axes that behave in non-standard ways.</li>
          <li>Hats should be mapped to buttons, one for each of the four directions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To identify the joystick elements on a particular platform, you may use the tools in the Rewired/DevTools folder. Open the JoystickElementIdentifier scene. Change the configuration in the Rewired Input Manager if you need to make a definition for a different input source than the default. Press play to see a readout of joystick elements as you move axes and press buttons on the device. You may split the game window and edit your hardware map while the game is running so you can see the readout of the elements.</li>
      <li>Link your new ControllerDataFiles to your Input Manager in the scene so it will recognize the new joysticks.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can add a new controller definition to an existing template. Be sure the new controller has similar elements and a similar layout. The steps are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First select the Hardware Joystick Map Template object from the Project view.</li>
      <li>Click the &quot;Launch Hardware Joystick Template Map Editor&quot; button in the inspector.</li>
      <li>In the window, select the &quot;Joysticks&quot; tab.</li>
      <li>Add a new joystick which will appear at the bottom of the list.</li>
      <li>Give this joystick a name. This is only used for identification purposes in this editor.</li>
      <li>You will need to get the GUID of the joystick you're adding from the Hardware Joystick Map file. Open the Hardware Joystick Map editor for the joystick you're adding, then copythe GUID from the &quot;Settings&quot; tab and paste it in the &quot;Joystick Guid&quot; field of the new joystick in the template editor.</li>
      <li>You will also need to get the Unity file GUID of the Hardware Joystick Map. This is different from the above GUID. You can obtain this file GUID enabling &quot;Visible Meta Files&quot; in Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Editor in the application menu, then navigating to the folder with the Hardware Joystick Map and opening the .meta file associated with the asset. The GUID should be clearly visible. Copy this GUID and paste it into the &quot;File Guid&quot; field of your new joystick in the template editor.</li>
      <li>On the &quot;Maps&quot; tab of the template editor, select your new joystick from the dropdown at the top.</li>
      <li>Click &quot;Add Entry&quot; to add a new element.</li>
      <li>You will be mapping each joystick element to a template element. The elements are listed by name.</li>
      <li>Add as many elements as there are Element Identifiers in your joystick.</li>

  <h3><a name="identifying-recognized-controllers" id="identifying-recognized-controllers"></a>Identifying recognized Joysticks</h3>
<p>
  If you need to identify a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> for some reason (you're building <a href="#display-glyph-for-action">a controller element glyph table</a> for example), you can determine the identity of a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> by using the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Joystick_hardwareTypeGuid.htm">joystick.hardwareTypeGuid property</a>. This will return the unique GUID of the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> type. (Note: This is a Rewired-generated GUID, not  from the hardware.) This GUID can be found in each HardwareJoystickMap on the Settings page. HardwareJoystickMaps can be found in the Assets/Rewired/Internal/Data/Controllers/HardwareMaps/Joysticks/ folder in your project.</p>
<p>(To save time, you can <a href="http://guavaman.com/rewired/files/docs/RewiredControllersCSV.zip">download a CSV file of the current controllers here</a>.)</p>
<p>If a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> is not a recognized controller, it will always return Guid.Empty (all zeros).</p>
<p>Be sure to note the <a href="ControllerMaps.html#xinput-devices-windows">special cases for certain controllers on some platfoms/input sources as noted here</a> as this affects what a controller is identified as.</p>

  <h3><a name="identifying-joysticks-windows-fallback-or-webplayer" id="identifying-joysticks-windows-fallback-or-webplayer"></a>Identifying controllers on Windows fallback or Windows Webplayer platforms</h3>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Unity fixed this issue on Windows in Unity 4.6.3p1 and an early version of Unity 5.x. You can check if the current version of Unity includes the fix by checking the value of <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_ReInput_unityJoystickIdentificationRequired.htm">ReInput.unityJoystickIdentificationRequired</a>. If true, you should allow your players to manually identify controllers using the methods described below.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Windows UWP in Unity fallback mode also has this same issue.</p>
<p>Because of limitations of Unity's input system, you need to take special measures on these platforms for controllers on Windows Standalone (only if you're <strong>not</strong> using native input -- Raw Input, Direct Input, or XInput -- native input does not have this problem) and Windows Webplayer (native input is not available in Webplayer). Note: This procedure is not required for OSX or other platforms.</p>

<p>Unity's input system has a major problem that makes it impossible to accurately identify which joystick id belongs to which physical controller in Windows. To solve this issue, at game start and at any point a controller is either connected or disconnected, you should ask the user to manually identify each controller one-by-one by pressing a button on the controller that matches the name displayed on-screen.</p>
<p>Rewired provides several functions to facilitate joystick identification:</p>
<p><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonOrAxisPress.htm">GetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonOrAxisPress</a> - Returns the 0 based id of the Unity joystick whose button or axis was pressed. -1 if no button or axis was pressed on any joystick.            Use this to identify controllers when using Unity's input system.            This has no effect if Unity Input is not handling input on the current platform. </p>
<p><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_GetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonPress.htm">GetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonPress</a> - Returns the 0 based id of the Unity joystick whose button was pressed. -1 if no button was pressed on any joystick.            Use this to identify controllers when using Unity's input system.            This has no effect if Unity Input is not handling input on the current platform. </p>
<p><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_SetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonOrAxisPress.htm">ReInput.controllers.SetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonOrAxisPress</a> - Sets a Unity joystick as the input source of a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>.            The first Unity joystick that returns a button or axis press will be assigned to the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>.            While no buttons or axes are pressed, this will return False. When a press is detected, it will return True and assign the joystick id. </p>
<p><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_SetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonPress.htm">ReInput.controllers.SetUnityJoystickIdFromAnyButtonPress</a> - Sets a Unity joystick as the input source of a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>. The first Unity joystick that returns a button press will be assigned to the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>.            While no buttons are pressed, this will return False. When a button press is detected, it will return True and assign the joystick id. </p>
<p><a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/M_Rewired_ReInput_ControllerHelper_SetUnityJoystickId.htm">ReInput.controllers.SetUnityJoystickId</a> - Sets a Unity joystick as the input source of a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a>.            Use this to remap a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> to its source when reconnected on platforms that use Unity Input.            This has no effect if Unity Input is not handling input on the current platform.</p>
<p>An example is included in Rewired/Examples/FallbackJoystickIdentification which you can look at to see how this is done.</p>
<p>The basic idea is this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>At game start, pop up a GUI asking the user to press a button on each named controller.</li>
  <li>When the user presses the button, set the joystick id on the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> so Rewired can identify which physical controller it is.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above steps for each controller attached to the system.</li>
  <li>Any time a controller is connected or disconnected, repeat the whole identification process for every controller.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the controllers are properly identified, you can use Rewired as usual to receive input, remap controllers, etc. and everything will function properly.</p>
<p>Note: If the user has more than one controller with identical names, there is no way to distinguish between the various controllers for identification. The order that the user identifies the controllers may change <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> to <a href="Players.html">Player</a> assignments. There is nothing you can do to prevent this. If this happens, the user will have to reassign the <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a> to <a href="Players.html">players</a> manually using a controller mapping screen. See <a href="#controller-mapping-screen">Creating a controller mapping screen</a> for more information.</p>

  <h3><a name="copying-input-config" id="copying-input-config"></a>Copying input configuration to another project</h3>
  <p><a href="InputManager.html#how-data-is-stored">As explained in the Input Manager documentation</a>, Rewired's configuration settings are stored as serialized data inside the Rewired Input Manager Game Object. You can work with this Game Object like any other Game Object in Unity -- duplicate it, copy and paste it, create a prefab out of it, revert it to the prefab's default settings, etc. The settings contained in the GameObject will be carried over just like any other inspector settings when copied.</p>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong>    When copying assets in Unity to another project, you must also copy the asset's metadata or you will lose script references
  and have other issues. There are several ways to properly copy a GameObject from one project to another:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Export the object to a Unitypackage file and import it.</li>
    <li>Create a prefab and copy the files in the OS file manager.</li>
    <li>Copy the scene file in the OS file manager.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Export the object to a Unitypackage file and import it</strong></p>
  <p> You can create a Unitypackage file from assets by selecting them in the Project window and going to the menu Assets -&gt; Export Package. This will create a Unitypackage from the selected Project assets which will include the necessary metadata. Be sure to uncheck &quot;include dependencies&quot; or it will export a bunch of files from the Rewired folder too.</p>
  <p>Note that this does not work with a Game Object in the scene. In order to export a Unitypackage with the Rewired Input Manager in it, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html" target="_blank">you must first create a prefab</a> out of the Rewired Input Manager, then export that prefab file.</p>
  <p>In the new project, first, make sure Rewired is installed, then import the prefab by going to the menu Assets -&gt; Import Package -&gt; Custom Package and select the Unitypackage file you created.</p>
  <p><strong>Create a prefab and copy the files in the OS file manager</strong></p>
<p>First, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html" target="_blank">create a prefab</a> out of the Rewired Input Manager. Next, be sure that Visible Meta Files is enabled by going to the menu in the Unity Editor at Edit -&gt; Project Settings and selecting Visible Meta Files in the dropdown for Version Control. This will make Unity store its metadata in text files along with each asset instead of storing it in a location hidden away in the project. For each asset in your project, there will be an additional file with a .meta extension.</p>
<p>In the other project, make sure Rewired is installed. Then in the OS's file manager, select both the .prefab file you created and the .meta along side it in your first project and copy those to the Assets folder of your new project.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the scene file in the OS file manager</strong></p>
<p>If you don't want to create a prefab out of your Rewired Input Manager, you can instead copy the entire scene file to your new project in the OS file manager. Make sure Rewired is installed in your second project first, then copy the scene file. Open the scene file and the Rewired Input Manager will have all the same data as in your first project. Note that any other objects in your scene depending on assets or scripts that do not exist in this new project will be broken.</p>

  <p>Unity's launcher has a built-in input tab that allows players to customize input through the Unity input manager settings. With Rewired, this interface is not only irrelevant, it is problematic. Rewired sets up over 400 input manager entries to be able to get input from all controllers on Unity fallback platforms. The user should not be allowed to make changes to these default inputs. However Unity gives you no option to hide this input manager settings tab in the launcher. There are three options to deal with this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Disable the launcher. This has the disadvantage of preventing the user from changing the display resolution. To disable it, see Display Resolution Dialog setting in the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PlayerSettingsStandalone.html" target="_blank">Unity Player settings</a>.</li>

<li>Hack the launcher to hide the input tab. There are no clear guidelines on how to do this, but <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/remove-input-section-from-launcher.141438/#post-991442" target="_blank">this forum post </a>shows how one user did it on Windows.</li>
<li>Disable the launcher completely and implement your own custom launcher. This allows you to give your user resolution display options as well. (The Unity player can be launched with command line options which set the resolution. <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html">See the section Unity Standalone Comand Line Arguments for more information</a>.)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3><a name="optimization" id="optimization"></a>Optimizing performance</h3>
<p>For mobile platforms, squeezing out as much performance as possible is important. Here are some tips to help optimize Rewired's performance in your game:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you do not ever get input in FixedUpdate or OnGUI in your game, make sure these Update Loops are disabled in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Input Manager - Settings</a> page. Each additional update loop you have enabled increases CPU usage of Rewired.</li>
  <li>The more <a href="Players.html">Players</a>, <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a>, enabled <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a>, and ActionElementMap bindings you have, the more cpu time is required to evaluate input for each of these every update.</li>
  <li><a href="#enabling-disabling-controller-maps">Disable all Controller Maps</a> that are not needed in the current game state. For example, if you have a <a href="MapCategories.html">Map Category</a> for UI controls, disable all UI <a href="ControllerMaps.html">Controller Maps</a> when the UI is not displayed.</li>
  <li>Use integer contstants instead of string names for calling methods that take an Action, Map Category, or Layout. String comparison is slower than integer comparison. See <a href="#exporting-constants">Exporting constants for use in scripting</a> for information on how to get a list of constants.</li>
  <li>If your game doesn't need keyboard input on certain platforms, disable it using the platform options in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor - Settings</a> page.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Input Events</strong><br />
  If you are getting input by using input events, you are shifting the burden of polling for input events on Rewired instead of your scripts which increases its CPU usage. Not only that, but any code in your script that is run in the input event callback will be attributed by the profiler to InputManager_Base instead of your script.</p>
<p><strong>Unity Profiler, Debug Build, and Unity Editor Performance</strong><br />
  Unity's profiler in Debug builds tends to report significantly inflated CPU usage for Rewired's InputManager_Base.Update. For example, testing shows that on the PlayStation Vita platform, the profiler will report CPU time up to 2x actual CPU time when timed manually in a Release build. <a href="Troubleshooting.html#xbox-one-profiler">XBox One can report CPU usage of 20x the CPU usage when using a Debug build vs a Development build.</a> In testing on Windows, release builds performed on average 2.5x faster in Unity 4.3 and 3.5x faster in Unity 5.4 than when timed inside the Unity editor. Rest assured, Rewired's core update loop has already been heavily optimized for performance.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Profile</strong><br />
  If you enable Deep Profile in the Unity Profiler, InputManager_Base will show a drastically inflated CPU usage due to the fact that Deep Profile uses reflection to get method information. The depth of Rewired's call stack dramatically increases this performance penalty, making it look as if Rewired is taking a huge percentage of the processing time when in reality this is just profiler overhead.</p>

<h3><a name="appletv-siri-remote" id="appletv-siri-remote"></a>Using Apple Siri Remote on Apple TV</h3>
<p>In general, the Siri Remote works like any other <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> in Rewired.</p>
<p>Special mappable elements on the Remote:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Touchpad X, Y</strong> - The X and Y values returned by the remote touchpad. This value is affected by the remote's current relative/absolute setting. This can be changed by setting <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/tvOS.html" target="_blank">UnityEngine.Apple.TV.Remote.reportAbsoluteDpadValues</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Pitch</strong> - Returns a -1.0 to +1.0 value based on the current tilt of the remote. Returns 0 when the remote is held with the touchpad end of the remote facing directly up. Positive values correspond to a tilt of the remote toward the screen relative to the 0 position. Negative values correspond to a tilt of the remote away from the screen relative to the 0 position.</li>
  <li><strong>Rotate</strong> - Returns a -1.0 to +1.0 value based on the current rotation of the remote. Returns 0 when the remote is held with the touchpad end of the remote facing directly up. Positive values correspond to a clockwise rotation of the remote from the 0 position. Negative values correspond to a counter-clockwise rotation of the remote from the 0 position.</li>
  <li><strong>Acceleration X, Y, Z</strong> - Returns the acceleration X, Y, and Z vectors.</li>
  <li><strong>Gravity X, Y, Z</strong> - Returns the Gravity X, Y, and Z vectors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Joystick Assignment<br />
</strong>If using <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> auto-assignment (enabled by default), the Siri Remote is treated as any other <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> and will be assigned to the first <a href="Players.html">Player</a> found that needs a <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joystick</a> assigned based on your current settings. If making a 1-player game, it is highly recommended that you raise the &quot;Max Joysticks Per Player&quot; setting to a large number such as 100 so that all attached <a href="Controllers.html#joysticks">Joysticks</a> will be assigned to the <a href="Players.html">Player</a>. This will allow the <a href="Players.html">Player</a> to use the Siri Remote or any gamepad attached without issue.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/tvOS.html" target="_blank">Unity Documentation for Apple TV</a> for more information on special considerations for publishing on tvOS.</p>

  <h3><a name="using-arcadeguns-g500"></a>Using ArcadeGuns G-500 AimTrak Light Guns</h3>
  <p>In order for the AimTrak G-500 to work with Rewired, the device must first be configured properly. See <a href="SupportedControllers.html#configuring-arcadeguns-g500">Supported Controllers - Configuring ArcadeGuns G-500 AimTrak Light Guns</a> for more information.</p>
  <p>The data returned by the AimTrak light guns is not processed by Rewired into  a screen-space or world-space coordinate system. The data is returned as it is received from the device. The data must be processed in your scripts in the appropriate manner for your intended use.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell that the data is from the AimTrak would be to create 2 special <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> specifically for this controller. Something like AimTrakX and AimTrackY. Then in your scripts you can simply check for these <a href="Actions.html">Actions</a> and process the values in to the appropriate coordinate system. Alternately, you could check an <a href="#get-contributing-input-sources">Action's contributing input sources</a> to determine if that <a href="Actions.html">Action</a> was contributed to by the AimTrak by checking the <a href="http://guavaman.com/projects/rewired/docs/api-reference/html/P_Rewired_Joystick_hardwareTypeGuid.htm">joystick.hardwareTypeGuid</a> property. If the guid is 1708268b-3914-42c4-a339-7bf4fe83fde2, then it is from the AimTrak G-500. (This guid can be found in the HardwareJoystickMap controller definition.)</p>

<h3><a name="asmdef-files" id="asmdef-files"></a>Using asmdef files with Rewired</h3>
<p>The asmdef system in Unity 2017.3 allows you make script files compile into their own assembly. This is an advanced topic and should not be attempted without thorough knowledge of the asmdef system.</p>
<p>Rewired does not support asmdef files out of the box. You 
  will have to   manage everything with regards to asmdef files. You have to be very knowledgeable about asmdef files and 
  assembly references   to plan the structure. There is no  &quot;right&quot; way to   organize it. Every organization scheme has its own advantages and 
  disadvantages.</p>
<p>Rewired contains DLLs and separate script files, both runtime and editor.
  You have to manage the asm def files to make sure all the scripts get 
  included in the correct assembly and that they have references to the 
  Rewired DLL's that they need (runtime and/or editor).</p>
<p> <strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>DO NOT move the   Rewired_Core.dll file out of its current location. This 
    file is used as an   anchor allowing Rewired to locate its install folder 
    location in the   editor.</li>
  <li> Do not move other files and folders around inside the Rewired installation   unless you are 
    prepared to manually manage all upgrades to Rewired including   all upgrades 
    to added extras, integration packs, addons, etc. installed by Rewired. Rewired relies on its internal folder structure to know where to extract addon packs when installing or upgrading them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One   example asmdef structure:</strong></p>
<p>Under 
  /Rewired/:<br />
  |--   Rewired_CSharp.asmdef</p>
<ul>
  <li> The primary asmdef file. This .asmdef file will   compile all C# scripts under the Rewired folder into   Rewired_CSharp.dll.</li>
  <li>.asmdef file must be set to compile on all platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under   /Rewired/Internal/Scripts/Editor/:<br />
  |-- Rewired_CSharp_Editor.asmdef</p>
<ul>
  <li>.asmdef file will compile the default editor C# scripts to 
    Rewired_CSharp_Editor.dll.</li>
  <li>.asmdef file must be set to compile only in the Editor.</li>
  <li>.asmdef file must have a reference to   Rewired_CSharp.asmdef.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every addon pack installed that includes editor scripts must   have an additional 
  Rewired_PACKNAME_CSharp_Editor.asmdef file added to the   Editor folder in that pack which 
  references Rewired_CSharp.asmdef and   Rewired_CSharp_Editor.asmdef.</p>
<p>Example, under /Rewired/Extras/ControlMapper/Scripts/Editor/:<br />
  |-- Rewired_ControlMapper_CSharp_Editor.asmdef</p>
<ul>
  <li>.asmdef file must have a reference to Rewired_CSharp.asmdef.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Disadvantages to this approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each addon-pack will add an additional assembly to your project. Tests by 
    others have shown that the more assemblies the project has, the longer it 
    will take to compile.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages to using asmdef files:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Any 3rd party asset that depends on a   Rewired integration pack or other addon will have 
    to also be added to an asmdef and a   reference added to the Rewired_CSharp 
    assembly.<br />
  </li>
</ul>

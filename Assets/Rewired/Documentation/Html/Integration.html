    </p>
    <p><strong>To install the Cinemachine Integration Pack, do the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download and install Cinemachine.</li>
      <li>Run the following menu item in the Unity editor:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Cinemachine -&gt; Install Integration Pack</strong></li>
  </ol>
    <p><strong>To Uninstall:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete the Rewired/Integration/Cinemachine folder</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Add a RewiredCinemachineBridge component to a GameObject in the scene. If you add it to the Rewired Input Manager GameObject, you can assign Actions easier by using dropdowns instead of typing strings.</li>
      <li>Create Actions for controlling Cinemachine in the Rewired input manager  assign them to Controller Maps in Players per standard Rewired practice. By default, the Cinemachine look camera uses two axes: &quot;Mouse X&quot; and &quot;Mouse Y&quot;.</li>
      <li>Create Cinemachine Axis to Rewired Action mappings in the Rewired Cinemachine Bridge inspector to map Cinemachine Axis names to Rewired Actions for each Player.</li>
      <li>All axis string names used by Cinemachine must match exactly to Action names you specify in the Rewired Cinemachine Bridge inspector.</li>
</ol>
    <p>To use multiple Cinemachine cameras with multiple Players:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up the Axis names in the Cinemachine camera inspectors for each Player. Use different strings for each Player. For example: &quot;Player 1 Look X&quot;, &quot;Player 1 Look Y&quot; for Player 1, &quot;Player 2 Look X&quot;, &quot;Player 2 Look Y&quot; for Player 2, etc.</li>
      <li>Create Axis to Action mappings in the Rewired Cinemachine Bridge for the Axis names you set up in the cameras for each Player.</li>
      <li>See the the image below for an example:</li>

    <p><a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/corgi-engine-2d-2-5d-platformer-26617?aid=1011l3LkF" target="_blank">Corgi Engine</a> by <a href="http://moremountains.com/" target="_blank">More Mountains</a> is a popular 2D + 2.5D platformer template for Unity.</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Corgi Engine v4.0  (No future version compatibility is guaranteed.)</li>
      <li> Unity 5.6.3f1+</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To install the Corgi Engine Integration Pack, do the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Corgi Engine first before you install Rewired. If you installed Rewired before Corgi Engine, be sure to re-launch the Rewired installer after Corgi Engine finishes installing and allow it to install the Unity input manager entries again because installing Corgi Engine will have replaced Rewired's entries. To re-launch the installer from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</strong></li>
      <li>When installing Rewired, install the Touch Controls pack when prompted. If you skipped installation, you can install the Touch Controls from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Extras -&gt; Touch Controls -&gt; Install</strong></li>
      <li>To install the Corgi Engine integration pack, run the following menu item in the Unity editor:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Corgi Engine -&gt; Install Integration Pack</strong></li>
      <li>After the pack is installed, you may need to run the setup script which will set the Script Execution Order on the Corgi Engine input manager script:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Corgi Engine -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Setup</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>To Uninstall:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete the Rewired/Integration/CorgiEngine folder</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
    <p>Add a Rewired Input Manager to the scene. You can add a pre-configured Rewired Input Manager for Corgi Engine to the scene from the menu:<br />
      <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Corgi Engine -&gt; Create -&gt; Rewired Input Manager</strong></p>
    <p>Anywhere where you use the Corgi Engine InputManager component, replace it with the RewiredCorgiEngineInputManager component. You can add the component through the menu:<br />
      <strong>Component -&gt; Corgi Engine -&gt; Manager -&gt; Rewired Input Manager</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Touch Controls:</strong></p>
    <p>A default Touch Controller prefab is included in the Rewired/Integration/CorgiEngine/Prefabs folder. You can use this Touch Controller in place of the one that comes with CorgiEngine. To to replace the existing Touch Controller in the demos, you need to add the Touch Controller prefab into the scene underneath the UICamera. Next, find the GUIManager component and replace the references in the fields &quot;Buttons&quot;, &quot;Arrows&quot;, and &quot;Joystick&quot; with references to the new Touch Controller elements. Specifically hook the main Touch Controller object to the &quot;Buttons&quot; field, then hook the Arrows sub-object to the &quot;Arrows&quot; field, then the Joystick sub-object to the &quot;Joystick&quot; field. These steps are just so you can use the same CorgiEngine InputManager options to display the touch controls and are not mandatory if you'd rather manage their display yourself. You can look at the demo scene Mesa1 located in Rewired/Integration/CorgiEngine/Demos to see the Touch Controls in use. For general information on Rewired's Touch Controls, <a href="TouchControls.html">see the documentation on Touch Controls</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Inventory System:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Corgi Engine inventory system uses the Unity UI StandaloneInputModule to control navigation.

    <p>Rewired can be used to provide input for <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/2943?aid=1011l3LkF" target="_blank">UFPS</a> by Opsive, a popular first person shooter kit. Rewired comes pre-packaged with an integration kit that was designed to work with UFPS 1.4.9.</p>
    <p><strong>The UFPS integration was designed for UFPS 1.x and is not compatible with UFPS 2.x. For UFPS 2.x, see <a href="#UFPS2">UFPS: Ultimate First Person Shooter</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>To install the UFPS Integration Pack, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure that you are running Unity 4.5 or greater.</li>
      <li>Install Rewired and UFPS first. If UFPS is not installed, you will get errors when the integration pack is installed.</li>
      <li>Run the following menu item in the Unity editor:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; UFPS -&gt; Install Integration Pack</strong></li>
      <li>Follow the on-screen prompts.</li>
      <li>When installation is complete, you will need to create a Rewired UFPS Input Manager in your scene before Rewired will be able to handle input. You can do this from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; UFPS -&gt; Create UFPS Rewired Input Manager</strong></li>
      <li>The Rewired UFPS Input Manager contains default settings for all of UFPS's controls for the keyboard, mouse, and dual analog gamepads. If you want to customize the controls, simply click the &quot;Rewired UFPS Input Manager&quot; then edit the settings in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html">Rewired Editor</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>To Uninstall:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete the Rewired/Integration/UFPS folder</li>
      <li>Delete the Rewired UFPS Input Manager from the scene</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>UFPS's built-in input manager will no longer have any effect as long as the Rewired UFPS Input Manager exists in the scene. Additionally, some UFPS functions such as those designed to let you remap keys will no longer have any effect. You should manage key remapping using Rewired instead.</li>
      <li>The Rewired UFPS integration pack makes no changes to the UFPS source code. You are therefore free to update UFPS as you see fit without losing the integration with Rewired.</li>
      <li>If you install UFPS after installing Rewired, UFPS will overwrite the /ProjectSettings/InputManager.asset in your project. This will overwrite Unity input manager entries that Rewired needs to be able to get mouse input or to get joystick input on platforms that fall back on Unity input as the input source. If this happens, simply reinstall Rewired's Input Manager settings by running the installer from the menu <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</strong> and allow it to add the necessary entries in the InputManager.asset file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
    <p class="question">The fire button (gamepad right trigger) and right stick look do not work unless I click the mouse button in the main window first. This happens in both the editor and game build. How do I fix this?</p>
    <p>This issue is not with Rewired, but rather it is an intentional functionality of UFPS.</p>
    <p>The Rewired integration only goes so far as to change the input sources for the Actions requested by the various UFPS scripts by replacing the underlying input manager. It doesn't alter the functionality or code of UFPS in any way so it cannot modify this behavior because the Action processing is blocked in the UFPS character script.</p>
    <p>UFPS is in control of the mouse pointer control. It doesn't allow you to fire or move the right stick (mouse look) unless the mouse pointer is captured regardless of the platform. There is an inspector option on the UFPS character controller (VP_FPInput -&gt; Mouse Cursor -&gt; Blocks Mouselook) that changes the mouse capture behavior for the right stick, however this doesn't solve the issue with firing.</p>
    <p>The only way to &quot;fix&quot; the issue with the fire button (right trigger) is to change UFPS source code. In VP_FPInput.cs, search for the function called InputAttack and find the two lines that read. </p>
    <pre class="code">if (!vp_Utility.LockCursor) <strong><span class="comment">// &lt;-- Comment out this line</span></strong>
  return; <strong><span class="comment">// &lt;-- Comment out this line</span></strong></pre>
    <p>Note that I cannot provide support on how to use UFPS. This information was only added here because I receive support requests on this issue on a regular basis.  If you have issues with UFPS, you should contact the developer, <a href="http://opsive.com" target="_blank">Opsive</a> for support.</p>
    <p class="question">I get warnings in the console saying the Actions &quot;LeftTrigger&quot; and &quot;RightTrigger&quot; are missing the first time I press the gamepad triggers in every game session. How do I fix this?</p>
    <p>This occurs because the developer of UFPS added LeftTrigger and RightTrigger Actions to UFPS recently when they added joystick support. They were not added to the default UFPS Rewired Input Manager because they were only added to UFPS as a way to convert analog gamepad trigger axis values to button values, but  Rewired handles this already using the default Attack action. Adding the Actions would just add confusion since they would be unused and only added to silence those warnings. The warnings are harmless and only show up the first time you press the triggers. If you really want to get rid of the warnings, add two Actions called LeftTrigger and RightTrigger.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE: This integration pack is designed to work with Universal Fighting Engine (1.x) and is not compatible with UFE2. UFE2 is a separate product and not code-compatible with Universal Fighting Engine. <a href="#UniversalFightingEngine2">Use the UFE2 integration instead if you are using UFE2</a>.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Universal Fighting Engine 1.8.4 (not compatible with UFE2) (No future version compatibility is guaranteed.)</li>
      <li> Unity 2017.2.0f3+</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To install the Universal Fighting Engine Integration Pack, do the following:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Universal Fighting Engine first before you install Rewired. If you installed Rewired before Universal Fighting Engine, be sure to re-launch the Rewired installer after Universal Fighting Engine finishes installing and allow it to install the Unity input manager entries again because installing Universal Fighting Engine will have replaced Rewired's entries. To re-launch the installer from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Setup -&gt; Run Installer</strong></li>
      <li>Install Control Mapper from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Extras -&gt; Control Mapper -&gt; Install</strong><br />
      </li>
      <li>To install the integration pack, run the following menu item in the Unity editor:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Universal Fighting Engine -&gt; Install Integration Pack</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>To Uninstall:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete the Rewired/Integration/UniversalFightingEngine folder</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the UFE Global Editor –&gt; Input Options:
        <ul>
          <li>Set &ldquo;Input Manager&rdquo; to &ldquo;Rewired&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Change the names of all inputs for both players to:
            <ul>
              <li>For the horizontal axis: &ldquo;Horizontal&rdquo;</li>
              <li>For the vertical axis: &ldquo;Vertical&rdquo;<br />
                For each numbered button: &ldquo;Button1&rdquo;,   &ldquo;Button2&rdquo;, &ldquo;Button3&rdquo;, &ldquo;Button4&rdquo;, &ldquo;Button5&rdquo;, &ldquo;Button6&rdquo;</li>
              <li>For the Start button: &ldquo;Start&rdquo;</li>
              <li>Be sure to remove the &quot;p1&quot; / &quot;p2&quot; prefix from the input names as Rewired does not use this. Both Player 1 and Player 2's input names should be identical.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
      <li>Add a pre-configured Rewired Input Manager for Universal Fighting Engine to the scene from the menu:<br />
        <strong>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Integration -&gt; Universal Fighting Engine -&gt; Create -&gt; Rewired Input Manager</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Customizing Action Names:</strong></p>
    <p>You can change the display names or the actual   scripting names of the Actions in the Rewired Input Manager, but if you change the scripting names, make   sure you change them in the UFE global configuration to match.</p>
    <p><strong>Touch Controls:</strong></p>
    <p>      The integration comes with pre-built touch-screen controls. You can set which platforms and under what circumstances the touch controls will be shown by setting the options on the Rewired UFE Input Manager inspector. For more information on customizing the touch controls, see the <a href="TouchControls.html">Touch Controls documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>To test touch controls (using the mouse) in the editor, you can enable   them in the editor by going to the Rewired UFE Input Manager and in the   inspector under Rewired UFE Input Manager, check the box &ldquo;Editor&rdquo; under &ldquo;Show   Touch Controls On&rdquo; and unplug any joysticks or disable the option &ldquo;Hide Touch   Controls When Joysticks Connected.&rdquo;      </p>
    <p><strong>In-Game Control Remapping:</strong></p>
    <p>To remap controls, go to the Options page in   UFE and select &ldquo;Change Controls&rdquo;. When you press &ldquo;Done&rdquo; the configuration will   be saved to XML and will be used the next time you use that controller on that   Player. To clear the XML data if you want to make changes in the Rewired Input   Manager, clear Player Prefs using the debug options foldout on the   UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs component on the Rewired Input Manager.    </p>

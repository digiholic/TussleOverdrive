    <h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
    <p>Control Mapper is a customizable, responsive control mapping system included with Rewired that you can use in your games. This system provides complete controller remapping including keyboard, mouse, and joystick support, axis calibration, joystick and mouse sensitivity, single or multiple players, controller maps, and much more. Control Mapper can be fully controlled with keyboard, mouse, joystick, and/or touch controls. Control Mapper uses Unity's new GUI system and therefore requires Unity 4.6+.</p>
<p>Control Mapper has many options which you can customize to fit your game's needs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Optional display of Players for multiplayer games.</li>
      <li>Optional multiple controllers per-player.</li>
      <li>Optional Input Behavior customization.</li>
      <li>Optional Map Category display.</li>
      <li>Customizable list of Actions to show per category.</li>
      <li>Optional display of Action category names.</li>
      <li>Optional Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller support.</li>
      <li>Choose the number of alternate fields per controller type.</li>
      <li>Customizable theme settings for changing colors and button styles.</li>
      <li>Customizable language settings for changing button and window labels and messages.</li>
      <li>Menu control by your choice of Rewired Player(s).</li>
      <li>Customizable Actions for opening, closing, and canceling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example screen showing multiple players, multiple controllers per-player, sensitivity settings, multiple map categories, with keyboard, mouse, and controller support.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The information that follows assumes you are familiar with working with input in Rewired. If you are not, read through the <a href="Documentation.html">documentation</a> first. Step by step basics of how to use Rewired will not be covered here.</p>
    <p>Control Mapper files including examples can be found in the Rewired/Extras/ControlMapper folder.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<hr />
    <h2><a name="setup" id="setup"></a>Setup</h2>
    <p>The Control Mapper is a prefab which you can drag into your scene and use. This prefab includes the Canvas which will be used to render the UI elements.</p>
    <p>To add Control Mapper to your scene, you can add it from either of the following menus:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Create -&gt; UI -&gt; Control Mapper</li>
    <li>Game Object -&gt; Create Other -&gt; Rewired -&gt; UI -&gt; Control Mapper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or you can add it as a live prefab by dragging it in from the project view. (Note: If using a live prefab, do not commit any changes to the prefab source or they will be overwritten the next time you update Rewired. You can, however, make a new prefab of your own out if it and modify that.)</p>
<p>Once the Control Mapper is in your scene, you can customize many options by changing settings in the inspector. The first thing you must do is to link your Rewired Input Manager object to the Control Mapper object in the Rewired Input Manager field in the inspector. Once you have done this, you can proceed to customize settings.</p>
    <p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_inspector_rewired-input-manager.png" width="676" height="47" /></p>
    <p>See <a href="#inspector-options">Inspector Options</a> for more details about the Control Mapper inspector settings.    </p>
    <h3><a name="rewiredstandaloneinputmodule" id="rewiredstandaloneinptmodule"></a>RewiredStandaloneInputModule</h3>
<p>Control of the UI is handled by the RewiredStandaloneInputModule. This component must be added to the EventSystem in the scene and the default StandaloneInputModule must be disabled or removed.</p>
    <p>You can either create a normal Unity Event System and replace the Standalone Input Module with the Rewired Standalone Input Module component or you can create a Rewired Event System from either of the menu items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GameObject -&gt; Create Other -&gt; Rewired -&gt; UI -&gt; Rewired Event System</li>
      <li>Window -&gt; Rewired -&gt; Create -&gt; UI -&gt; Rewired Event System</li>
      </ul>
    <p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_rewiredstandaloneinputmodule.png" width="469" height="275" class="right" />Four Actions must be set up in the Rewired Input Manager and the RewiredStandaloneInputModule in order to control the UI. <strong>These four Actions must have names that match exactly in both the Rewired Input Manager and the RewiredStandaloneInputModule</strong>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Horizontal Axis - The Action that will control Left/Right movement in the UI.</li>
      <li>Vertical Axis - The Action that will control Up/Down movement in the UI.</li>
      <li>Submit - The Action that submits a button.</li>
      <li>Cancel - The Action that cancels.</li>
    </ol>
      <p>The actual names you use are up to you. Of course these Actions must also be assigned to one or more keyboard or joystick maps and assigned to a Player to be functional. </p>
<p>NOTE: It is <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommended that you create unique menu-only Actions for these UI controls in a separate controller map category from your game Actions. If you use your in-game actions such as &quot;Move Horizonal&quot; or &quot;Jump&quot; for these UI controls, you run the risk of allowing the user to render the UI unusable because they removed an assignment for one of these game Actions which was also  controlling the UI.</p>
<p>The settings in the RewiredStandaloneInputModule will determine which Players can control the UI. If you check &quot;Use All Rewired Game Players&quot;, all Players besides the System Player that have a map configured with these UI Actions will be able to control the UI. If you check &quot;Use Rewired System Player&quot;, the same will be true for the System Player. If instead you only want specific Players to control the UI, you can set these Player Ids individually.</p>
<p>If the UI control speed with a Joystick seems too slow or fast, adjust the &quot;Input Actions Per Second&quot; setting.</p>
<h3><a name="setup-rewired-input-manager" id="setup-rewired-input-manager"></a>Rewired Input Manager settings
</h3>
<p>This image shows the 4 actions that have been set up for controlling the UI.</p>
<p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_rewiredinputmanager_uiactions.png" width="484" height="291" /></p>
<h3><a name="setup-recommended-control-scheme" id="setup-recommended-control-scheme"></a>Recommended UI control scheme</h3>
<p>Rewired and the Control Mapper system are very flexible. As such, every possible situation cannot be &quot;automagically&quot; taken care of for you. You need to spend some time to plan and understand your control scheme.</p>
    <p>It is possible to create a situation where the user is able to break his ability to control the UI by unassigning necessary Actions such as the Submit button. With a mouse available on the system, this would not be a problem as it is not dependent on Actions, but on platforms without mouse or touch input to fall back on in the case of user error, you need to consider these situations. It may not be advisable to allow users to remap everything.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="setup-keyboard" id="setup-keyboard"></a>Keyboard:</strong><br />
      It is generally a good idea to have fixed keyboard UI controls that the user cannot remap, such as the arrow keys for navigation and the enter keys for submit. These can either be owned by the System Player or any/all of your Players. You can set up a separate Map Category for these protected UI controls and protect them from being replaced during reassignment excluding this Map Category from conflict checking in all your other Map Categories in the Rewired Input Manager. Also, do not add this Map Category to the list of assignable maps in the Control Mapper inspector options.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="setup-mouse" id="setup-mouse"></a>Mouse</strong>:<br />
      Do not assign UI Submit or Cancel Actions to Mouse Left Button or Mouse Right Button or you will receive double-clicks evey time the mouse button is pressed over a button. The mouse button click on a UI element is based on mouse cursor screen position and does not use the Action system. If you assign these UI Actions to the mouse buttons, if a button/field is currently selected and you click anywhere on the screen, the selected buton/field will receive the UISubmit or UICancel Action regardless of where you click on the screen.</p>
<p><strong><a name="setup-joysticks" id="setup-joysticks"></a>Joysticks:</strong><br />
  Recognized joysticks should have a map created for UI control if you wish to support joystick UI navigation. If you want the user to be able to remap these menu controls, it is recommended that you create yet another separate  Map Category for these user-configurable joystick controls. By making a separate Map Category for these controls, you are able to allow the user to remap these joystick controls while still keeping the keyboard controls protected. Conflict checking settings for the Map Category should exclude all game controls and vice versa if you want the user to be able to map the same elements in different categories without being warned about conflicts.</p>
    <p><strong><a name="setup-unknown-controllers" id="setup-unknown-controllers"></a>Unknown Controllers:</strong><br />
    It is recommended that you create a map for the Unknown Controller in the UI control category. This way, if a user attaches a controller Rewired does not recognize, they should still be able to control the UI reasonably well.</p>
    <p>There is no way to know what axes or buttons will actually be available on these controllers, but you can make some basic assumptions that should allow most controllers to control the UI.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Axis 0: Map to your &quot;UIHorizontal&quot; Action. (Axis 0 is almost always the horizontal axis on the first joystick)</li>
      <li>Axis 1: Map to your &quot;UIVertical&quot; Action and Invert this axis. (Axis 1 is almost always the vertical axis on the first joystick and is always inverted.)</li>
      <li>Button 0: Map to your &quot;UISubmit&quot; Action.</li>
      <li>Button 1: Map to your &quot;UICancel&quot; Action.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_unknowncontrollermap.png" width="712" height="171" /></p>
    <p>Of course, the above are only recommendations. You can set up your control scheme however you decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><a name="saving-and-loading" id="saving-and-loading"></a>Saving and Loading User Data</h2>
    <p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_userdatastore.png" width="554" height="97" /></p>
    <p>Saving and loading of user data is handled by the <a href="UserDataStore.html">UserDataStore</a> component on the Rewired Input Manager. By default, this component does not exist on the Rewired Input Manager. Without this component, data will never be saved or loaded and will not persist between game sessions.</p>
    <p>If you add a UserDataStore derived component to the Rewired Input Manager, it will be used to save and load data. Rewired includes a UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs component which will use PlayerPrefs to save the controller data. Simply add this component to your Rewired Input Manager and data will be loaded and saved as needed.</p>
    <p>Control Mapper will save data when any of the following occur:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Control Mapper window is closed by the user.</li>
      <li>A joystick is unplugged.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Control Mapper will load saved data when any of the following occur:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At runtime start if &quot;Load Data On Start&quot; is checked in the UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs component inspector.</li>
      <li>A joystick is plugged in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are using multiple different Rewired Input Managers in different scenes, they all must have a UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs component and the &quot;Player Prefs Key Prefix&quot; must match in order for the same save data to be loaded by each Rewired Input Manager.</p>
    <p>If you don't want to use PlayerPrefs, you can create your own data storage system using UserDataStore. See <a href="UserDataStore.html">User Data Store</a> for more information.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: Saved XML data is not updated when you make changes to the Rewired Input Manager</strong></p>
    <p>Control Mapper does not manage changes between the Rewired Input Manager and data that is already saved to XML. If you make changes to the Rewired Input Manager settings such as adding new controls to a Joystick Map, these new changes will not be preserved when loading saved XML data. The only automated solutions would be to either clear the save data by clearing Player Prefs so that the Rewired Input Manager defaults are used instead or load the default maps in the Player for the any controllers that changed and save those to XML overwriting the existing saved mappings.</p>
    <p>Management of saved user data is up to the developer. If you have special needs beyond the basic use cases, you should extend and replace the <a href="UserDataStore.html#playerprefs">UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs</a> component with a new UserDataStore component that meets your specific needs.</p>
    <h3 style="background-color:#FF6"><a name="clear-xml-data" id="clear-xml-data"></a>***IMPORTANT***:</h3>
    <p>When doing testing, if you open and close the Control Mapper screen or unplug a joystick while the Control Mapper screen is open, you are causing it to save XML data in the registry even if you didn't change any mappings or settings. The next time you start the game (provided the Rewired Input Manager with the UserDataStore_PlayerPrefs component is present in the scene), it will load that saved XML data from the registry, NOT the default settings stored in the Rewired Input Manager. While doing testing, you will most likely want to clear this saved data so the default settings in the Rewired Input Manager are loaded instead of the saved data. This can be done by clearing Player Prefs by opening the &quot;Debug Options&quot; foldout on the Rewired Input Manager inspector.</p>
<p>If you are confused by your input configuration not matching what you defined in the Rewired Input Manager, or you are seeing different behaviors in the Unity Editor versus a game build, you most likely are loading XML data that you are unaware that you saved. Clear Player Prefs and everything will reset to the defaults.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
    <h2><a name="conflict-checking" id="conflict-checking"></a>Conflict Checking</h2>
<p>Rewired's conflict checking system tries to prevent the user from cross-assigning his controls. For example, if the user tries to assign the key A to &quot;Fire&quot; after it has already been assigned to &quot;Jump&quot;, a warning will be displayed asking the user whether they would like to replace the assignment or (optionally) add the new conflicting assignment anyway. (See <a href="#inspector-options">Inspector Options</a> for the option to allow conflicting assignments.)</p>
<p>The Rewired Input Manager has many options for controlling conflict checking. These are handled on a Map Category basis. You are able to set which Map Categories perform conflict checking against other Map Categories. This conflict checking is configurable independently each way, so if you want one Map Category to conflict check against another but not vice versa, this is possible. Additionally, this allows you to have categories such as &quot;Common&quot;, &quot;Infantry Mode&quot;, &quot;Tank Mode&quot;, &quot;Airplane Mode&quot; and have all these maps configurable by the user without having conflict checking between mutually-exclusive Map Categories such as &quot;Tank Mode&quot; and &quot;Infantry Mode&quot; while all still conflict checking against &quot;Common&quot; and vice versa. See <a href="RewiredEditor.html#MapCategories">Rewired Editor - Map Categories</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Protected controls</strong></p>
<p>You may want to have certain controls protected from re-assignment. One example of this might be the ESC key if you use that for some important system control and you don't want the user removing this assignment by trying to assign ESC to another Action. In Rewired, protection of controls is handled on the Map Category level. To protect a set of System controls from ever being re-assigned, uncheck the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#MapCategories">&quot;User Assignable&quot; checkbox in the Map Category</a> that contains the Action in the Rewired Input Manager.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Map Category -&gt; User Assignable</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that not all &quot;User Assignable&quot; checkboxes in the Rewired Input Manager are equal. The &quot;User Assignable&quot; checkbox also appears in Action Categories and Actions themselves, but only the Map Category &quot;User Assignable&quot; checkbox is used in determining protected controls.</p>

<p><img src="files/images/controlmapper_theme1.png" width="300" height="279" /></p>
    <p>Control Mapper comes with a basic theming system to allow you to change colors, fonts, and sprites by simply editing a theme file.</p>
    <p><strong>The process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of the DefaultTheme file in the ControlMapper/Themes directory.</li>
      <li>Move this copy to somewhere inside your project (outside the Rewired folder).</li>
      <li>On the Control Mapper game object in your scene, assign the new theme file you created to the Theme field in the inspector.</li>
      </ol>
    <p><strong>Editing the theme:</strong></p>
    <p>Edit the theme file in the inspector. There is no user-friendly inspector for this theming process, but the names of the fields should be self-explanatory. Make your changes and they will show up when you launch the game. (Theme setting changes can not be viewed in real-time in the editor.)</p>
    <p>These theme options  just mirror the various options available on Unity UI components such as Image, Button, Slider, etc. If you don't understand what these options mean, see the Unity UI documentation on these components.</p>

<p></p>
    <p>Control Mapper has a basic language system which you can use to customize button and section labels, window titles, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>The process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make a copy of the DefaultEnglish file in the ControlMapper/Languages directory.</li>
      <li>Move this copy to somewhere inside your project (outside the Rewired folder).</li>
      <li>On the Control Mapper game object in your scene, assign the new language file you created to the Language field in the inspector.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Editing the language:</strong></p>

    <h2><a name="misc-notes" id="misc-notes"></a>Misc Notes</h2>
    <p><strong>Opening and closing the screen</strong></p>
    <p>The easiest way to control the screen is by assigning Actions in the <a href="#screen-control-actions">Screen Control Actions section of the inspector</a>.</p>
    <p>Another way is by using a Unity UI button and assigning ControlMapper.Open() to the OnClick event.</p>
    <p>You can also control the screen through scripting:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Opening the screen: ControlMapper.Open();</li>
      <li>Closing the screen: ControlMapper.Close();</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Control Mapper also has events for when the screen is opened and closed should you need that information.</p>
<p><strong>Changing settings through scripting</strong></p>
    <p> Certain Control Mapper options can be changed through scripting, but not in real-time while the screen is open. This can be useful should you need to make changes based on some criteria such as platform-specific settings. For example, before initializing the Control Mapper (before opening it), you could disable keyboard support. This may be useful if you're publishing your game on a platform that doesn't support keyboards, but you don't want to create a separate Control Mapper for this.    </p>
    <p><strong>Screen scale</strong></p>
    <p>Scale of the Control Mapper by default is handled by the Canvas Scaler Fitter component on the Canvas below the main Control Mapper game object. The Canvas Scaler Fitter component controls the scale settings for the display based on the current aspect ratio of the screen. Breakpoints have been predefined to help keep the display usable at various screen aspect ratios.</p>

    <h2><a name="faq" id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p class="question">How do I center the Control Mapper window?</p>
<p>ControlMapper -&gt; Canvas -&gt; MainPageGroup</p>
<p>Set equal paddings on Left, Top, Right, and Bottom and the window will be centered.</p>
<p class="question">Is it possible to visually edit the Control Mapper layout in real-time?</p>
<p>Not easily. Control Mapper has many dynamically-generated UI elements which are generated at runtime based on the options set in the inspector. It is not a static UI layout that can easily be edited in real-time. However, you can press Play in the editor and edit some settings to get a preview of how changes might look. In order to commit those settings though, you have to stop Play mode and remake the changes to the game objects while it is not in Play mode.</p>
<p class="question">I want to customize more  than what's available in the theme settings. How do I do that?</p>
<p>The theme was meant to provide basic customization of the styles on all elements because they're dynamically generated. Basic functional customization is done through the Control Mapper inspector. Anything beyond that is out of the scope of the tool and up to you to implement if you choose to and requires a very good knowledge of Unity UI.</p>
<p>There are certain areas which you cannot change the layout  because they're generated by scripting such as the columns of input fields. Other things can be moved and reordered such as the various sections at the top. But be aware that some changes will cause problems. One thing everyone seems to want to do is to move the Done button to the bottom. I advise against this because the auto-scroll system put in place for the input field grid will make it so you have to scroll through every Action entry before it will jump down to the Done button. </p>
<p>Alignments, padding, spacing, etc. can be changed with the standard options in Unity's UI system for the various UI game objects in the hierarchy.</p>
<p> You  have to know Unity UI very well and you can customize it pretty much however you want with the exception of the input grid. If you want to change that (beyond styling), you'll have to edit source code. And be aware that the layout, especially concerning the input grid scroll area, is prone to breaking depending on what you do.</p>
<p>The basic groupings that pre-exist in the scene can all be rearranged at will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WindowButtonGroup</li>
  <li>PlayersGroup</li>
  <li>ControllerGroup</li>
  <li>SettingAndMapCategoriesGroup</li>
  <li>InputGridGroup</li>
</ul>
<p>You can press Play and change the order of these in the hierarchy and see them switch places in real-time. Committing changes requires you do it again outside Play mode though.  The objects inside these groups are dynamically generated based on settings in the Control Mapper inspector. In addition, visibility of these groups may also be affected by Control Mapper inspector options. You could manually set backgrounds on these groups in by adding Image components to them.</p>
<p>Any dynamically generated elements are loaded from the prefabs:  Rewired/Extras/ControlMapper/Prefabs/Parts</p>
<p>Some things you could customize by modifying the prefabs, while some options would be overridden by the theme when it loads.</p>
<p>The ControlMapper-&gt;Canvas: Canvas Scaler Fitter component governs responsive break points. It can be disabled if you don't need that functionality.</p>
<p>If you need to modify any source prefab components, it's best to work with copies of everything so you can still update Rewired and not lose your changes. If you copy all the prefabs, you will need to re-assign the copies as the sources for the dynamically generated objects in the ControlMapper inspector -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Internal Data -&gt; Prefabs section.  If you want to customize the popup windows, they are also in the prefabs folder. Same rules apply. Copy them, then re-assign the copies as the prefab sources.</p>
<p class="question">How can I disable/hide the Pre-Input Assignment Time screen? I don't really need it because my game doesn't use analog input. I tried setting the time to 0 but it still flashes for a moment.</p>
<p>There is no way to disable that without changing the source code.<br />
  <br />
Even if your game doesn't use analog input, your players may still use physical analog controls. Disabling this would be a bad idea because the purpose of it is to prevent any inadvertent assignments such as when releasing a stick and its action of auto-centering itself registers as a negative stick movement mapping that to your Action.</p>

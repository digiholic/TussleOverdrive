<h3><a name="not-compatible-unity-new-input-system" id="not-compatible-unity-new-input-system"></a>Rewired is not compatible with Unity's &quot;new&quot; input system</h3>
<p>Unity has introduced a new input system which changes the way Unity handles input. Rewired is not compatible with Unity's new input system. If you enable the new input system by setting this value to &quot;Input System&quot; or &quot;Both&quot;, Rewired and/or Unity's input system may not function at all or parts of each system may not function correctly. While some platforms may work, others may not.</p>
<p>The only setting supported by Rewired is:<br />
  Player Settings -&gt; Active Input Handling -&gt; Input Manager</p>

<h3><a name="running-in-a-sandbox" id="running-in-a-sandbox"></a>Running in a Sandbox</h3>
<p><strong>Windows (tested with Sandboxie):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>  Due to a lack of permissions, Rewired is unable to receive device information from Raw Input when run inside a sandbox. Joysticks will not work properly in Raw Input mode. (As a note, Unity itself is also unable to receive this information, rendering joystick support in Unity broken under the default security settings.)</li>
  <li>Direct Input mode is able to receive joystick input, but joystick plug/unplug notifications are blocked, so hot-plugging does not work properly even in Direct Input mode.</li>

<h3><a name="windows-editor-oculus-touch-crash" id="windows-editor-oculus-touch-crash"></a>Windows Editor: Crash in Unity 5.6+ with Oculus Touch</h3>
<p>There have been multiple reports of  crashes in Unity 5.6+ on Windows when using Unity input as the input source with Oculus Touch controllers attached. This crash is not due to Rewired but is a Unity issue. It can be reproduced without Rewired involved by calling GetAxis and GetButton on the Oculus Touch controllers through UnityEngine.Input. It seems to occur most frequently immediately when pressing Play in the editor. It may be related to calling UnityEngine.Input on the Oculus Touch devices in Awake or on the first Update frame. It can reportedly be avoided by disabling the Rewired Input Manager in the inspector, then enabling it after Play mode has been entered. The effect this has is to defer making calls to UnityEngine.Input until after the first frame or two of Play mode.</p>

<h3><a name="xinput-device-name" id="apple-tv-gyro2"></a>Windows Platforms: XInput devices on Windows appear as &quot;XInput Gamepad&quot;</h3>
<p>On Windows, with Use XInput enabled, and always on Windows App Store and Windows 10 Universal builds, there's no way to differentiate one XInput controller type from another. To XInput, everything is simply Gamepad with an id of 0-3. This is not a Rewired issue, it is a design decision by Microsoft.<br />
  <br />
  There is no possible way to associate an   XInput id to the matching HID device to get its name and make it be recognized   as a specific controller. Because of this, you cannot identify an XInput controller by   name in Windows when XInput is enabled. This also affects which controller maps   are loaded for this joystick in Windows when using XInput. Since the device is   simply an Xinput device, it will be loaded from the XBox 360 controller   definition, not the Logitech F310, for example. 
  (However, if you create your controller maps using the Gamepad Template, you don't even need to worry about this.)
<p>The only way you will be able to identify these   controllers by name is to disable Use XInput in the Rewired Input Manager (applies to Windows Standalone only, not Windows App Store or Windows 10 Universal -- XInput cannot be disabled on these platforms). Once you do that, you introduce new   issues/limitations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>L/R triggers are treated as 1 combined axis and both   cannot be pressed simultaneously without canceling each other out.</li>
  <li>You lose universal XInput controller support because   each XInput controller now must be specifically recognized and mapped. Any unrecognized XInput devices will be treated as Unknown Controllers.</li>
  <li>Vibration is not supported without XInput enabled.</li>
  <li>The Steam Controller as well as Steam Streaming and Steam Link can no longer be supported if using Raw Input.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ol>

<h3><a name="windows-xinput-devices-use-x360-map" id="windows-xinput-devices-use-x360-map"></a>Windows Platforms: All XInput devices use the Xbox 360 Controller map when &quot;Use XInput&quot; is enabled</h3>
<p>As explained in the <a href="#xinput-device-name">previous topic</a>, when Use XInput is enabled and always on Windows App Store and Windows 10 Universal builds, there is no way to differentiate one XInput device from another by name or product/vendor id. Therefore, all XInput devices will use the Xbox 360 Controller map on Windows when Use XInput is enabled. This will match all XInput devices, generic or not, and will provide full coverage of all XInput devices. You cannot map these devices based on the individual device type such as Xbox One or Logitech F310 when using XInput because the device cannot be identified as as specific device type  but rather simply as an XInput gamepad. All XInput gamepads will use Xbox 360 Controller profile when Use XInput is enabled.</p>
<p>If you disable Use XInput, you will get device-specific identification and recognition (Windows Standalone only, not Windows App Store or Windows 10 Universal), but you will also have the drawbacks <a href="#xinput-device-name">explained in the previous topic</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="more-than-4-xbox-controllers" id="dll-not-found-xinput6"></a>More than 4 XBox controllers cannot be used at the same time</h3>
<p><strong>Windows Standalone</strong><br />
  XInput has a hard limit of 4 devices. This is not a Rewired limitation, it is a limitation in Microsoft's XInput system.</p>
<p>You can mix and match non-XInput devices with XInput devices for a total of more than 4, but you cannot use more than 4 XInput compatible devices simultaneously if XInput is enabled. If you need to support more than 4 XInput controllers, you must disable XInput in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor - Settings</a> page.</p>
<p>Be advised that by disabling &quot;Use XInput&quot; in the Rewired Input Manager, you introduce these new   issues/limitations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>L/R triggers are treated as 1 combined axis and both   cannot be pressed simultaneously without canceling each other out.</li>
  <li>You lose universal XInput controller support because   each XInput controller now must be specifically recognized and mapped. Any unrecognized XInput devices will be treated as Unknown Controllers.</li>
  <li>Vibration is not supported without XInput enabled.</li>
  <li>The Steam Controller as well as Steam Streaming and Steam Link can no longer be supported if using Raw Input.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>OSX Standalone</strong><br />
  XBox 360 controllers on OSX require <a href="https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases" target="_blank"> this XBox 360 driver</a>. This driver also imposes the 4-device limit just like XInput. It is currently not possible to use more than 4 XInput devices simultaneously on OSX. Again, you can mix and match non-XInput controllers to achieve a total count greater than 4. Because the driver is required for the controller to be detected, there is no way to disable the use of this driver and get around this issue.</p>

<p>There have been reports of crashes when using XInput on one or more versions of Windows 10 Insider Preview. The crash can occur either on the start of the application (if an XInput-compatible device is attached) or when any XInput-compatible device is first attached.

<h3><a name="windows-10-fallback-xbox-one-mapping-issues" id="windows-10-xbox-one-crash2"></a>Windows Standalone (Unity Fallback, Windows 10): Xbox One Controller L/R and D-Pad mapping problems</h3>
<p>Due to Microsoft driver issues, on versions of Windows 10 before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the L/R triggers and D-Pad on the Xbox One Controller may be mapped incorrectly and non-functional when using Unity Fallback input. Microsoft made Xbox One Controller driver changes in an early version of Windows 10 that caused the controller mappings to change when retrieving values through the HID driver. This change did not affect XInput. Unity uses a combination of direct HID device access and XInput to get input from XInput compatible devices. This caused the standardized mappings in Unity's input system to break, cross-mapping the D-Pad and the triggers. Microsoft acknowledged this as a mistake and finally rolled back this driver change in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update rolled out on August 2, 2016. After this update, the mappings reverted to the normal mappings consistent with Windows 7. Only users using Windows 10 pre-Anniversary update are affected. This does not affect Rewired if using the native input options instead of Unity fallback input.</p>

<p>Microsoft changed the XBox One driver in Windows 10 and changed the mappings compared to Windows 7 and prior versions, then after the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, they reverted this driver  change. When using Unity fallback as the input source, it is impossible to differentiate the XBox One controller on Windows 10 pre and post Anniversary Update. Therefore, the decision was made to support only the newest mapping. Xbox One Controllers will have incorrect mappings on Windows 10 prior to the Anniversary Update.</p>

<h3><a name="net46-windows-freeze-on-exit" id="net46-windows-freeze-on-exit"></a>Windows Standalone, .NET 4.6 experiemental backend: Application freezes on exit in Unity 2017</h3>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This Unity bug was fixed at some point in the Unity 2017 branch and does not appear in Unity 2017.4.14f1. The exact version where they fixed the bug is not known. It does not appear in Unity 2018.1.0f3 or later.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Update to the Unity 2017.4.14f1+.</p>
<p>As of Unity 2017.2.0f3, when the .NET 4.6 experimental backend is enabled in Windows, the application will freeze forever on exit (closing via the X window button or Alt + F4). The error occurrs outside Rewired's code after it has already shut down. Unity has confirmed this bug in the .NET 4.6 backend but no ETA for a fix is known.</p>
<p><strong>Q: But it used to work before updating Rewired to 1.1.3.0+:</strong></p>
<p>It actually did have the same issue, but you just 
  couldn’t see it because Rewired was never actually running in native mode when 
  the 4.6 backend was enabled in versions prior to 1.1.3.0 because of an unrelated exception <br />
  that made it fall back to Unity input silently. This exception was due to an unrelated issue involving 
  reflection when using the .NET 4.6 backend. The exception was silently swallowed forcing Rewired 
  to run in UnityEngine.Input mode instead. In 1.1.3.0, the silent exception was fixed allowing native input to actually be initialized revealing the new .NET 4.6 bug. Native input never worked when using the 
  4.6 .NET backend. The fact that older versions looked like they worked was

<h3><a name="uwp-gamepads-appear-twice" id="uwp-gamepads-appear-twice"></a>Windows 10 Universal: Certain gamepads appear twice when HID device support is enabled</h3>
<p>Microsoft has apparently started mapping non-Xbox gamepads like the Sony DualShock 4 to make them appear as XInput devices through their UWP Windows.Gaming.Input system. This has the side effect that, if you enable the application to allow the use of HID input devices in the Package.appxmanifest, the DualShock 4 will show up as 2 devices at the same time -- an XInput gamepad and the HID DualShock 4 gamepad. While true XInput gamepads provide a way to identify them as such through the HID system, Microsoft has provided no way to determine that these pseudo-XInput devices (HID devices are being  treated as XInput devices) are being handled by XInput, so there is no way to programatically filter out these duplicate devices. The only workaround is to disable HID device support. You can either do this by removing HID support from the package manifest in the Visual Studio build project or by disabling the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#settings-uwp">&quot;Support HID Devices&quot; option in the Rewired Input Manager -&gt; Settings -&gt; Windows UWP page</a>. This allows you to choose to support the Gamepad (XInput) system and/or the HID system for input devices. This is still not ideal, but it at least gives you the option to disable XInput to allow for wider device support without risking duplicate devices, though disabling XInput will also disable support for controller vibration. There is no perfect solution because Microsoft simply has not provided the ability to get the necessary information to allow devices to be filtered properly.</p>

<h3><a name="uwp-il2cpp-controller-disconnect-crash" id="uwp-il2cpp-controller-disconnect-crash"></a>Windows 10 Universal IL2CPP: Crash when disconnecting controllers</h3>
<p>There are three different disconnect crash scenarios, each with its own circumstances:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: XInput controllers on Unity 2018.2.0 - 2018.2.18</strong></p>
<p><strong>Severity: <span  style="color: #ff0000">Critical</span></strong></p>
<p><strong style="color: #008800">This issue was fixed by Unity in version 2018.2.19. Update to Unity 2018.2.19+.</strong><strong><span  style="color: #ff0000"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>Starting with Unity 2018.2.0, XInput-compatible controllers will crash the application when unplugged if the application is started with any XInput-compatible controller connected. This is a bug in Unity, not Rewired, and there is no possible workaround.</p>
<p>This bug occurs when any script or library makes a call to any part of the Windows.Gaming.Input.Gamepad API. Simply making this call will result in Unity crashing internally the next time a controller is unplugged. Use of Windows.Gaming.Input.Gamepad is absolutely required in order to get input natively from gamepads in Windows UWP.</p>
<p>You can easily reproduce this by creating a new Unity project and adding this script to a GameObject:</p>
<pre class="code">using UnityEngine;

public class GamepadTest : MonoBehaviour {
#if ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT
    void OnGUI() {
        GUILayout.Label("Gamepad Count: " + Windows.Gaming.Input.Gamepad.Gamepads.Count);
    }
#endif
}</pre>
<p>Build the application and launch it with a gamepad connected. Unplug it and the application will crash with the following stack trace:</p>
<pre class="code">UnityPlayer.dll!dynamic_array&lt;class GameControllers::Gamepads::XboxGamepad,0&gt;::erase(class GameControllers::Gamepads::XboxGamepad *,class GameControllers::Gamepads::XboxGamepad *)

<p>This affects the .NET scripting backend and the IL2CPP scripting backend.</p>
<p>Solution: Update to Unity 2018.2.19+.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Non-XInput controllers</strong></p>
<p>As of Unity 5.3.4f1, after enabling support for standard HID joysticks in the Package.appxmanifest, Unity may crash when disconnecting a non-XInput controller (also happens with XInput controllers in Untiy 2017). This is a bug in Unity, not Rewired and there is no possible workaround if you want to support any controllers besides XInput controllers. (To disable support for non-XInput controllers, remove the <a href="SpecialPlatformSupport.html#uwp-enabling-hid-joystick-support">tags added to the Package.appxmanifest mentioned here</a>.) This bug has been reported to Unity, but so far no fix has been announced.</p>
<p>This issue does not affect Windows 10 Universal builds when using the .NET scripting backend.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> This bug has been fixed as of Unity 5.3.5p1.<br />
  <strong>Update 2:</strong> This bug has resurfaced in Unity 2017.1.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Xbox One S controller</strong></p>
<p>As of Unity 2017.1, after enabling support for standard HID joysticks in the Package.appxmanifest and disabling Use XInput in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor -&gt; Settings for Windows 10 UWP</a>, the application will always crash when disconnecting an Xbox One S controller. This issue comes from the Windows HID API used to get HID device events. When Use XInput is enabled, the Xbox One S controller will be handled through the Windows.Gaming.Input API instead and no longer cause the crash.</p>

<h3><a name="uwp-shift-keys" id="uwp-shift-keys"></a>Windows 10 Universal: Left Shift is activated when Right Shift is pressed</h3>
<p>The left and right Shift keys cannot be differentiated on Windows UWP due to a bug/oversight in the Windows UWP API. Windows does not send key up events for the opposing Shift key when released while holding down the other Shift key. This makes it impossible to support both Shift keys as individual keys. Because of this issue, the two Shift keys can only reliably be treated as a single key. When either Shift key is pressed, only Left Shift will will return true. Right Shift will never return true. This is an issue with the underlying Windows UWP API and not a Rewired bug. There is no possible workaround.</p>

<p>As of Unity 2017.2.0f3, when the .NET 4.6 experimental backend is enabled in OSX, an exception will be thrown on initialization causing Rewired to not function.

<p>Due to the severity of this bug, until Unity fixes it, it is impossible for Rewired to use native input on OSX with the .NET 4.6 backend enabled.

<p>Rewired uses UnityEngine.Input.GetKey to get keyboard input on Linux. Underlying issues in UnityEngine.Input's keyboard handling are inherited by Rewired.</p>
<p>This bug only affects builds on Linux, not the Linux editor. It also only affects certain versions of Linux.</p>
<p>Unity has already patched the issue in 2018.2.0b2. The change causing this bug was added in some version of Unity after 2017.1.0f3 (see tests below).</p>
<p>UnityEngine.Input.GetKey now toggles on and off in rapid succession frame by frame after a short key-repeat delay. This makes it so that the ButtonDown state becomes true every few milliseconds. Because Unity is telling Rewired that the key going on and off in rapid success, Rewired translates this into GetButtonDown and GetButtonUp every few frames. There's absolutely no way around this other than writing a native keyboard library for Linux and replacing UnityEngine.Input for this portion of input. This may be added in a future release and this page will be updated.<br />

<p><strong>Update: A workaround was added in Rewired 1.1.28.0.</strong></p>
<p>The setting Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Script Changes While Playing -&gt; Recompile After Finished Playing causes Rewired to stop working when making a change to a script while in Play mode.</p>
<p>Rewired must be able to tell when recompilation starts and ends in order to safely shut down and re-initialize. Rewired uses various functions in the Unity API to determine this. It relies on UnityEditor.EditorApplication.isCompiling to know when this process has started and ended.</p>
<p>When you change the option to &quot;Recompile After Finished Playing&quot;, Unity sets the value of UnityEditor.EditorApplication.isCompiling to True immediately when it detects a change to a script even though the application is not actually compiling. It never sets this value back to false because the setting makes it wait until Play mode ends before it can actually recompile. Meanwhile, Rewired has shut itself down when it detected the start of recompilation. It waits until Unity tells it compliation has ended before it reinitializes itself. Since the value from Unity remains False forever, Rewired stays shutdown until Play mode is stopped and restarted. This is a bug in Unity, not Rewired.</p>

<p>Unity has made a major breaking change. The Unity UI library has been moved from UnityEngine.UI.dll as part of the core Unity installation to Unity.ugui.dll as an optional install through the Package Manager. This change to the DLL name which breaks all assembly references in Rewired's DLLs. This issue affects all DLLs that reference Unity UI, not just Rewired, including many of the most popular assets on the Unity Asset Store. There is no possible workaround to this issue.</p>
<p>Unity has acknowledged these changes as a mistake and has made changes to allow DLLs to work again in a later alpha/beta release. <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/ui.673504/">See this forum thread for more details</a>.

<h3><a name="increased-compile-play-time-editor" id="increased-compile-play-time-editor"></a>Rewired increases compile time and load time after pressing Play in the editor</h3>
<p>The additional load time can be attributed entirely to Unity loading the serialized data from Rewired's <a href="SupportedControllers.html">many controller definitions</a> which are used to recognize, map, and calibrate known controllers. The simple fact that the controller data files are linked from an object field in the Rewired Input Manager GameObject's component causes Unity to load those objects regardless of whether the GameObject is enabled or not. Unfortunately there's nothing that can be done to reduce it except to <a href="HowTos.html#excluding-controller-definitions">remove controller definitions</a> to reduce the number that have to be loaded. <br />
  <br />
  Unity has to deserialize all the controller definition data every time you press Play or recompile scripts. There isn't any way to both keep the support for all these controllers and get the startup time any faster without completely overhauling the controller definition system to use a database or some other means to store all this data. Doing that would bring all kinds of other challenges and issues because it would have to be cross-platform and work on every single platform Unity supports (22+ now) and would invalidate any custom controller definitions created by users. Rewired was written using the &quot;Unity way&quot; of doing things, using their data storage structures, built-in systems, and editors. Unfortunately, this means I don't have control over every single aspect of the process.<br />
  <br />
  While this increase in startup time may be significant to a blank project, in a real game project, it's likely that the game itself's startup time would be significantly greater than this and therefore the perceived impact would be much smaller vs a blank scene.<br />
  <br />
  It is worth noting that there is no perceivable difference in load time in a final build. A completely blank scene and a scene with an enabled Rewired Input Manager both start instantaneously (Unity splash screen disabled.) This is only an issue in the Unity editor.</p>
<p><strong>How to temporarily remove Controller definitions to speed up development</strong></p>
<p>The fewer controllers supported, the less the delay when the app domain is rebuilt. Just click the &quot;ControllerDataFiles&quot; field in the Rewired Input Manager inspector which will take you to the default ControllerDataFiles object in the Rewired directory, copy the existing ControllerDataFiles, move the copy outside the Rewired folder, link the new ControllerDataFiles in the Rewired Input Manager inspector, then go to the new ControllerDataFiles inspector and remove all the controllers you don't need while doing your development. You can pare this down to like 10 controllers (Xbox, DS4, etc.) and Rewired will add zero extra startup time. Remember to link back the original ControllerDataFiles in the Rewired Input Manager before building so all controllers are supported.</p>

<h3><a name="serialized-data-corruption-after-import" id="serialized-data-corruption-after-import"></a>Serialized data corruption after importing Rewired </h3>
<p>Unity has a major bug in the Unitypackage importer that can lead to data corruption when importing an asset from the Unity Asset Store or a Unitypackage file.</p>
<p>If your Unity <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-EditorManager.html" target="_blank">Editor Settings -&gt; Asset Serialization Mode</a> is set to &quot;Force Binary&quot;, serialized data may be corrupted when you import a Unitypackage. This often happens when a new Unitypackage is imported. If you then re-import the same package over the previous import, it will be imported correctly. If you then delete the imported files and re-import them, they will be corrupted again.</p>
<p>Corrupted serialized data in Rewired can manifest itself as inexplicable errors and exceptions being thrown for no reason making Rewired completely unusable. The best thing to do in this case is to change the Asset Serialization Mode to &quot;Mixed&quot; or &quot;Force Text&quot; and re-import Rewired. If that's not possible or you don't want to have to wait for all your assets to be re-imported in the new serialization mode, import the Rewired asset twice in a row (do not delete the Rewired folder after the first import). The serialized data should be intact after the second import.</p>
<p>This bug has been reported to Unity. They have been able to reproduce it and have sent it to the developers for resolution. No ETA was given.</p>
<p>Last tested version: Unity 5.3.5f0</p>
<p>Please note that this is a Unity bug and can affect any asset. This is not an issue with Rewired.</p>

<h3><a name="serialized-data-corruption-after-upgrading-unity" id="serialized-data-corruption-after-upgrading-unity"></a>Serialized data corruption after upgrading Unity</h3>
<p>Unity's data serializer has bugs which can cause serialized data in scenes and prefabs to become corrupt after upgrading Unity and allowing it to re-import the assets. This normally seems to happen with serialized strings. If you've recently upgraded Unity and you start seeing weird errors or warnings logged about Actions missing that have long nonsense string names, your serialized data may have been corrupted in Unity. There is no way to fix this other than to restore a backup. For this and many other reasons, it's imperative that you back up your project before upgrading Unity.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a Unity bug and can affect any asset. This is not an issue with Rewired.</p>

<h3><a name="installer-bug-1181" id="installer-bug-1181"></a>Installer error in Rewired 1.1.8.1</h3>
<p>Rewired 1.1.8.1 shipped with a bug that causes the installer to report an error upon installation in Unity 4.x and 5.x. Unity 2017 doesn't appear to have this issue.</p>
<p>Changes were made to the installer system in 1.1.8.1 to use a folder GUID to locate the Rewired folder. Rewired has to be able to determine the path of the main Rewired folder so it can handle file management (installing addons, documentation, etc.)  Rewired previously used Rewired_Core.dll as a fixed locator to find the main Rewired folder. Some users wanted to be able to move the Rewired_Core.dll to another location, but doing so before would cause Rewired's editor scripts to fail because Rewired could no longer find its main folder. A change was made in 1.1.8.1 to use the GUID of the Rewired/Internal folder to locate the Rewired folder instead. However, Unity 4.x and 5.x  do not preserve the GUID of folders in the Unitypackage making this new technique completely fail.  Rewired 1.1.8.2 corrects this error.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>First, enable visible meta files.
    
    This is done by selecting Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Editor in the application menu and enabling External Version Control support by selecting Visible Meta Files in the dropdown for Version Control.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Next, open Assets/Rewired/Internal.meta in a text editor.</li>
  <li> Change the GUID in the .meta file to:<br />
    8cdcfdd141b51d5458f981aaf449fd9f</li>
  <li>You may need to quit and restart the Unity editor for the change to take effect.</li>

<h3><a name="editor-is-compiling-gc-alloc" id="editor-is-compiling-gc-alloc"></a>InputManager_Base.Update generates 17 bytes of GC Alloc per frame in the Profiler</h3>
<p>This is normal and unavoidable  and only happens in the UnityEditor. It is due to a bug/change in Unity 2017.</p>
<p>The InputManager.cs script included in the project calls UnityEditor.EditorApplication.isCompiling every frame in the Editor. This call generates a 17 byte memory allocation every time. This does not generate garbage in Unity 4 or 5 but does in Unity 2017.</p>
<div data-redactor="1">This call is required to be able to detect when the Editor is compiling for various needs in the Editor. Again, it happens only in the Unity Editor, not in builds.

<h3><a name="android-remotes" id="windows-app-store-u"></a>Remotes are not detected  (Nexus Player, Amazon Fire TV, Razer Forge TV, etc.)</h3>
<p>These remotes may not work on versions of Unity 5.02 or greater. Unity introduced a new bug in this version that makes the remote appear with a NULL name in the Input.GetJoystickNames array, which also happens to be used to fill the array entry when a controller is no longer connected. There is no way to identify these remotes because of this. The bug still exists as of 5.3.4f1. It has been reported and this information will be updated if a fix is issued.</p>
<p>The remotes will however still return keycodes through UnityEngine.Input. Most remotes use the keyboard arrow keycodes for movement. In addition, there are various workarounds possible using Custom Controllers such as shown in the following code example:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// Copyright (c) 2016 Augie R. Maddox, Guavaman Enterprises. All rights reserved.

/*  Unity has a significant bug that prevents remotes from being recognized and handled as joysticks in Rewired.
    Therefore, the only workaround is to read the remote as (mostly) keyboard keys through UnityEngine.Input
    directly and feed this input to a Custom Controller. This script will read keyboard keys and
    Joystick Button 0 (on all joysticks) to determine the values to feed into the Custom Controller.
    
    To Use:
    1. Create a gameobject in the scene and assign this component to it and set the Player Id in the inspector.
    2. Create a Custom Controller in the Rewired Input Manager with 8 buttons and 0 axes.
    3. Asssign the Custom Controller to your Player and give it the tag &quot;AndroidRemote&quot;.
    4. Create a Custom Controller Map assigning Actions to each button.
    5. Assign the map to your Player.

    The element order is as follows:
    Button 0 = Up
    Button 1 = Down
    Button 2 = Left
    Button 3 = Right
    Button 4 = Center button
    Button 5 = Back button
    Button 6 = Menu button

However, Rewired includes support for the Ouya SDK which will allow you to use the Ouya SDK for joystick input. See the <a href="SpecialPlatformSupport.html#ouya">Special Platform Support - Ouya</a> for installation instructions.</p>

<h3><a name="ouya-sdk-4-controller-limit" id="ouya-sdk-4-controller-limit"></a>Ouya SDK: Cannot use more than 4 controllers</h3>
<p>When using the Ouya Everywhere SDK for joystick support, you cannot use more than 4 controllers. If you attach additional controllers beyond the 4-controller limit, the controller will be assigned to one of the same id's as another controller and both will control the same player. This is a limitation of the Ouya SDK, not Rewired.</p>

<h3><a name="sdl2-osx-editor-haptic-feedback-not-supported" id="sdl2-osx-editor-haptic-feedback-not-supported"></a>OSX - Editor does not support haptic feedback</h3>
<p>Due to a bug in SDL/Unity that causes an editor crash when enabled, haptic feedback (vibration) is not supported in the OSX Editor.</p>
<p>Note: This issue only applies if SDL2 is selected as the input source for OSX Standalone builds.</p>

<h3><a name="steam-windows-tab-shift-keys-stuck-overlay" id="steam-windows-tab-shift-keys-stuck-overlay"></a>Windows - Tab and Shift keys get stuck on after opening Steam overlay using the keyboard</h3>
<p>When opening the Steam overlay with Shift + Tab key combination, the Shift and Tab keys will remain stuck on forever until the user presses each of these keys to release them.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact that Rewired uses Raw Input for keyboard input. Steam does not forward the Raw Input key up events for these keys to the application when the overlay is opened, therefore Rewired cannot know that these keys were ever released.</p>
<p>The only workaround at present is to disable Native Keyboard Handling in <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor -&gt; Settings -&gt; Windows</a>. This makes Rewired use Unity input for the keyboard input source. Unity input does not have this issue because it uses the older Windows keyboard API and Steam does forward the messages using this older API.</p>

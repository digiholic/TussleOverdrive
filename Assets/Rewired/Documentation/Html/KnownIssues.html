    <h3><a name="unity-2011-dot-net-46-editor-errors" id="unity-2011-dot-net-46-editor-errors"></a>Editor corruption in Unity 2017.1 when using .NET 4.6 experimental backend</h3>
    <p>The .NET 4.6 experimental backend contains a major bug that affects Rewired's ability to run in the editor. The 2nd time you press Play in the editor, it will throw thousands of exceptions and cause the editor to become corrupt until quit and restart. This bug has been reported to Unity and they have acknowledged it. Until this bug is fixed, Rewired is not compatible with the .NET 4.6 experimental backend. See the following forum posts for more details about the issue.</p>

      </ul>
    <p>The only workaround is to disable native input by setting the input source for the editor platform to Unity in the Rewired Input Manager -&gt; Settings page. By doing this, you will lose access to all the special features and benefits native input provides.</p>

    <h3><a name="oculus-touch-editor-crash" id="oculus-touch-editor-crash"></a>Editor crash in Unity 5.6+ with Oculus Touch</h3>
    <p>There have been multiple reports of  crashes in Unity 5.6+ on Windows when using Unity input as the input source with Oculus Touch controllers attached. This crash is not due to Rewired but is a Unity issue. It can be reproduced without Rewired involved by calling GetAxis and GetButton on the Oculus Touch controllers through UnityEngine.Input. It seems to occur most frequently immediately when pressing Play in the editor. It may be related to calling UnityEngine.Input on the Oculus Touch devices in Awake or on the first Update frame. It can reportedly be avoided by disabling the Rewired Input Manager in the inspector, then enabling it after Play mode has been entered. The effect this has is to defer making calls to UnityEngine.Input until after the first frame or two of Play mode.</p>

    <h3><a name="running-in-a-sandbox" id="running-in-a-sandbox"></a>Running in a Sandbox</h3>
<p><strong>Windows (tested with Sandboxie):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>  Due to a lack of permissions, Rewired is unable to receive device information from Raw Input when run inside a sandbox. Joysticks will not work properly in Raw Input mode. (As a note, Unity itself is also unable to receive this information, rendering joystick support in Unity broken under the default security settings.)</li>
  <li>Direct Input mode is able to receive joystick input, but joystick plug/unplug notifications are blocked, so hot-plugging does not work properly even in Direct Input mode.</li>

<h3><a name="windows-app-store-u5" id="windows-app-store-u5"></a>Windows App Store support not working in Unity 5.0.0, fixed in 5.0.1</h3>
<p>Due to a new bug introduced in Unity 5.0.0, Rewired is unable to be compiled in this version of Unity. The bug was fixed in Unity 5.0.1, so upgrade to 5.0.1 if you need Windows App Store support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a name="android-remotes" id="windows-app-store-u"></a>Android remotes are not detected  (Nexus Player, Amazon Fire TV, Razer Forge TV, etc.)</h3>
<p>These remotes may not work on versions of Unity 5.02 or greater. Unity introduced a new bug in this version that makes the remote appear with a NULL name in the Input.GetJoystickNames array, which also happens to be used to fill the array entry when a controller is no longer connected. There is no way to identify these remotes because of this. The bug still exists as of 5.3.4f1. It has been reported and this information will be updated if a fix is issued.</p>
<p>The remotes will however still return keycodes through UnityEngine.Input. Most remotes use the keyboard arrow keycodes for movement. In addition, there are various workarounds possible using Custom Controllers such as shown in the following code example:</p>
<pre class="code"><span class="comment">// Copyright (c) 2016 Augie R. Maddox, Guavaman Enterprises. All rights reserved.

/*  Unity has a significant bug that prevents remotes from being recognized and handled as joysticks in Rewired.
    Therefore, the only workaround is to read the remote as (mostly) keyboard keys through UnityEngine.Input
    directly and feed this input to a Custom Controller. This script will read keyboard keys and
    Joystick Button 0 (on all joysticks) to determine the values to feed into the Custom Controller.
    
    To Use:
    1. Create a gameobject in the scene and assign this component to it and set the Player Id in the inspector.
    2. Create a Custom Controller in the Rewired Input Manager with 8 buttons and 0 axes.
    3. Asssign the Custom Controller to your Player and give it the tag "AndroidRemote".
    4. Create a Custom Controller Map assigning Actions to each button.
    5. Assign the map to your Player.

    The element order is as follows:
    Button 0 = Up
    Button 1 = Down
    Button 2 = Left
    Button 3 = Right
    Button 4 = Center button
    Button 5 = Back button
    Button 6 = Menu button
    Button 7 = Select button

<h3><a name="xinput-device-name" id="apple-tv-gyro2"></a>Windows Platforms: XInput devices on Windows appear as &quot;XInput Gamepad&quot;</h3>
<p>On Windows, with Use XInput enabled, and always on Windows App Store and Windows 10 Universal builds, there's no way to differentiate one XInput controller type from another. To XInput, everything is simply Gamepad with an id of 0-3. This is not a Rewired issue, it is a design decision by Microsoft.<br />
  <br />
  There is no possible way to associate an   XInput id to the matching HID device to get its name and make it be recognized   as a specific controller. Because of this, you cannot identify an XInput controller by   name in Windows when XInput is enabled. This also affects which controller maps   are loaded for this joystick in Windows when using XInput. Since the device is   simply and Xinput device, it will be loaded from the XBox 360 controller   definition, not the Logitech F310, for example. 
  (However, if you create your controller maps using the Dual Analog Gamepad Template, you don't even need to worry about this.)
<p>The only way you will be able to identify these   controllers by name is to disable Use XInput in the Rewired Input Manager (applies to Windows Standalone only, not Windows App Store or Windows 10 Universal -- XInput cannot be disabled on these platforms). Once you do that, you introduce new   issues/limitations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>L/R triggers are treated as 1 combined axis and both   cannot be pressed simultaneously without canceling each other out.</li>
  <li>You lose universal XInput controller support because   each XInput controller now must be specifically recognized and mapped. Any unrecognized XInput devices will be treated as Unknown Controllers.</li>
  <li>Vibration is not supported without XInput enabled.</li>
  <li>The Steam Controller as well as Steam Streaming and Steam Link can no longer be supported.</li>

<p>As explained in the <a href="#xinput-device-name">previous topic</a>, when Use XInput is enabled and always on Windows App Store and Windows 10 Universal builds, there is no way to differentiate one XInput device from another by name or product/vendor id. Therefore, all XInput devices will use the Xbox 360 Controller map on Windows when Use XInput is enabled. This will match all XInput devices, generic or not, and will provide full coverage of all XInput devices. You cannot map these devices based on the individual device type such as Xbox One or Logitech F310 when using XInput because the device cannot be identified as as specific device type  but rather simply as an XInput gamepad. All XInput gamepads will use Xbox 360 Controller profile when Use XInput is enabled.</p>
<p>If you disable Use XInput, you will get device-specific identification and recognition (Windows Standalone only, not Windows App Store or Windows 10 Universal), but you will also have the drawbacks <a href="#xinput-device-name">explained in the previous topic</a>.</p>
<p>There is rarely ever a need to map these controllers individually by using the specific device-type maps. Just create your Joystick Map using the Dual Analog Gamepad Template and it will cover <a href="SupportedControllers.html">all gamepads listed here</a> regardless of whether or not you have Use XInput enabled.</p>

<h3><a name="more-than-4-xbox-controllers" id="dll-not-found-xinput6"></a>More than 4 XBox controllers cannot be used at the same time</h3>
<p><strong>Windows Standalone</strong><br />
  XInput has a hard limit of 4 devices. This is not a Rewired limitation, it is a limitation in Microsoft's XInput system.</p>
<p>You can mix and match non-XInput devices with XInput devices for a total of more than 4, but you cannot use more than 4 XInput compatible devices simultaneously if XInput is enabled. If you need to support more than 4 XInput controllers, you must disable XInput in the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#Settings">Rewired Editor - Settings</a> page.</p>
<p>Be advised that by disabling &quot;Use XInput&quot; in the Rewired Input Manager, you introduce these new   issues/limitations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>L/R triggers are treated as 1 combined axis and both   cannot be pressed simultaneously without canceling each other out.</li>
  <li>You lose universal XInput controller support because   each XInput controller now must be specifically recognized and mapped. Any unrecognized XInput devices will be treated as Unknown Controllers.</li>

<p><strong>OSX Standalone</strong><br />
  XBox 360 controllers on OSX require <a href="https://github.com/360Controller/360Controller/releases" target="_blank"> this XBox 360 driver</a>. This driver also imposes the 4-device limit just like XInput. It is currently not possible to use more than 4 XInput devices simultaneously on OSX. Again, you can mix and match non-XInput controllers to achieve a total count greater than 4. Because the driver is required for the controller to be detected, there is no way to disable the use of this driver and get around this issue.</p>

<h3><a name="windows-10-fallback-xbox-one-mapping-issues" id="windows-10-xbox-one-crash2"></a>Windows Standalone (Unity Fallback, Windows 10): Xbox One Controller L/R and D-Pad mapping problems</h3>
<p>Due to Microsoft driver issues, on versions of Windows 10 before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, the L/R triggers and D-Pad on the Xbox One Controller may be mapped incorrectly and non-functional when using Unity Fallback input. Microsoft made Xbox One Controller driver changes in an early version of Windows 10 that caused the controller mappings to change when retrieving values through the HID driver. This change did not affect XInput. Unity uses a combination of direct HID device access and XInput to get input from XInput compatible devices. This caused the standardized mappings in Unity's input system to break, cross-mapping the D-Pad and the triggers. Microsoft acknowledged this as a mistake and finally rolled back this driver change in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update rolled out on August 2, 2016. After this update, the mappings reverted to the normal mappings consistent with Windows 7. Only users using Windows 10 pre-Anniversary update are affected. This does not affect Rewired if using the native input options instead of Unity fallback input.</p>

When using Unity fallback as the input source, it is impossible to differentiate the XBox One controller on Windows 10 pre and post Anniversary Update. Therefore, the decision was made to support only the newest mapping. Xbox One Controllers will have incorrect mappings on Windows 10 prior to the Anniversary Update.</p>

<h3><a name="uwp-gamepads-appear-twice" id="uwp-gamepads-appear-twice"></a>Windows 10 Universal: Certain gamepads appear twice when HID device support is enabled</h3>
<p>Microsoft has apparently started mapping non-Xbox gamepads like the Sony DualShock 4 to make them appear as XInput devices through their UWP Windows.Gaming.Input system. This has the side effect that, if you enable the application to allow the use of HID input devices in the Package.appxmanifest, the DualShock 4 will show up as 2 devices at the same time -- an XInput gamepad and the HID DualShock 4 gamepad. While true XInput gamepads provide a way to identify them as such through the HID system, Microsoft has provided no way to determine that these pseudo-XInput devices (HID devices are being  treated as XInput devices) are being handled by XInput, so there is no way to programatically filter out these duplicate devices. The only workaround is to disable HID device support. You can either do this by removing HID support from the package manifest in the Visual Studio build project or by disabling the <a href="RewiredEditor.html#settings-uwp">&quot;Support HID Devices&quot; option in the Rewired Input Manager -&gt; Settings -&gt; Windows UWP page</a>. This allows you to choose to support the Gamepad (XInput) system and/or the HID system for input devices. This is still not ideal, but it at least gives you the option to disable XInput to allow for wider device support without risking duplicate devices, though disabling XInput will also disable support for controller vibration. There is no perfect solution because Microsoft simply has not provided the ability to get the necessary information to allow devices to be filtered properly.</p>

<h3><a name="serialized-data-corruption-after-import" id="serialized-data-corruption-after-import"></a>Serialized data corruption after importing Rewired </h3>
<p>Unity has a major bug in the Unitypackage importer that can lead to data corruption when importing an asset from the Unity Asset Store or a Unitypackage file.</p>
<p>If your Unity <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-EditorManager.html" target="_blank">Editor Settings -&gt; Asset Serialization Mode</a> is set to &quot;Force Binary&quot;, serialized data may be corrupted when you import a Unitypackage. This often happens when a new Unitypackage is imported. If you then re-import the same package over the previous import, it will be imported correctly. If you then delete the imported files and re-import them, they will be corrupted again.</p>
<p>Corrupted serialized data in Rewired can manifest itself as inexplicable errors and exceptions being thrown for no reason making Rewired completely unusable. The best thing to do in this case is to change the Asset Serialization Mode to &quot;Mixed&quot; or &quot;Force Text&quot; and re-import Rewired. If that's not possible or you don't want to have to wait for all your assets to be re-imported in the new serialization mode, import the Rewired asset twice in a row (do not delete the Rewired folder after the first import). The serialized data should be intact after the second import.</p>
<p>This bug has been reported to Unity. They have been able to reproduce it and have sent it to the developers for resolution. No ETA was given.</p>

<p>Unity's data serializer has bugs which can cause serialized data in scenes and prefabs to become corrupt after upgrading Unity and allowing it to re-import the assets. This normally seems to happen with serialized strings. If you've recently upgraded Unity and you start seeing weird errors or warnings logged about Actions missing that have long nonsense string names, your serialized data may have been corrupted in Unity. There is no way to fix this other than to restore a backup. For this and many other reasons, it's imperative that you back up your project before upgrading Unity.</p>

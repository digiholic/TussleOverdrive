A value of 1.0 will have a normal amount of hitstun for its knockback, while a value of 2.0 will keep the opponent in hitstun for twice as long.

 Accepted conditional parameters:

For all kinds of objects:
== - var1 is equal to var2
!=  - var1 is not equal to var2

If both var1 and var2 are ints or floats, the following conditionals are allowed as well:
< - var1 is less than var2
> - var1 is greater than var2
<= - var1 is less than or equal to var2
>= - var1 is greater than or equal to var2

If both var1 and var2 are booleans, the following conditionals are accepted:
&& - both are true (AND)
|| - either are true (OR)
^ - exactly one value is true (XOR)
!& - either variable is false (NAND)
!| - both variables are false (NOR)
!^ - both variables are the same value (XNOR)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><b>InitVar</b> - <i>Similar to SetVar, except this will only set a value if there isn't already a variable set.

Be careful using this Subaction, as it can cause the fighter to become embedded in a wall or floor, potentially ejecting out the wrong side.

Due to the unknowable size of the map, this subaction must always be relative.</i><ul><li>xPos<ul><li>The amount to shift along the X axis.

If you intend to animate the new sprite or start at a subimage other than 0, make sure to call ChangeSpriteRate or ChangeSubimage in the same call as this one.</i><ul><li>spriteName<ul><li>The name of the sprite to change to. This will scrape the Fighter's Sprites directory, and look for the sprite sheet named [prefix]_[spriteName], with the prefix being the fighter's currently selected costume (usually just the fighter's name)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><b>ChangeSubimage</b> - <i>Changes the subimage to the given value, or modifies the current Subimage by the given amount if relative. The sprite manager will automatically modulo the Subimage, so, for example, changing to Subimage 5 of a sprite sheet that only has 4 subimages will loop back around to subimage 0 (oh yeah, it's zero indexed btw)

Since the Subimage was changed manually, it'll set the SpriteRate to 0, disabling the auto-animator. If you want to re-enable the auto-animator, make sure to call ChangeSpriteRate in the same call as this subaction.</i><ul><li>subimage<ul><li>The Subimage to change to, or, if Relative is set, the amount to change the subimage by. This will loop around the animation in both directions, so -1 will get the last, and higher numbers than the maxiumum will loop back around.</li></ul></li><li>relative<ul><li>If checked, the subaction will add the subimage value to the current subimage instead of setting it directly.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><b>Flip</b> - <i>Flips the fighter so it is facing the other direction. This will mirror the sprite or rotate the model to match. No arguments necessary.</i><ul></ul></li><li><b>Rotate</b> - <i>Changes the fighter's rotation to the given value, or modifies it by the value if relative is set.</i><ul><li>degrees<ul><li>The amount in degrees to set the rotation to, or the amount to change the rotation by if relative is set.</li></ul></li><li>relative<ul><li>If checked, this subaction will modify rotation instead of directly setting it</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><b>ShiftSprite</b> - <i>Changes the Sprite offset, shifting the sprite a set amount of pixels. This does not move the actual fighter position. For that, use the ShiftPosition subaction instead.</i><ul><li>xPos<ul><li>The amount of pixels to shift in the X diretion. Positive X is right, negative X is left.</li></ul></li><li>yPos<ul><li>The amount of pixels to shift in the Y direction. Positive Y is up, negative Y is down.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><b>Unrotate</b> - <i>Cancels all currently affected rotation and resets the fighter to its upright position.</i><ul></ul></li></ul><h1>OTHER</h1><ul><li><b>PlaySound</b> - <i>Plays the sound with the given name from the fighter's sfx directory.
